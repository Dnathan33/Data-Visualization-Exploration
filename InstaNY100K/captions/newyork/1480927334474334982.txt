I'm in serious disappointment with the recent spring weather in #NYC and even rained all day! Tomorrow [March 29] is finally supposed to be sunny. 🤞🏻 •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 🌻 This photo was taken from one of the most humid days last summer on July 22, 2016 at @nbk_farms and actually missing all the hair stuck to the sweat on my neck. Summer heat on my eyes, yes please! ☀️ •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• 📷 @tyshkadesign #Williamsburg #Brooklyn #NewYork #summer2016 #NYClife #WilliamsburgBridge #Manhattan #skyline #GoGreen #flowerpower #sunflower #słonecznik #picnic #wanderlust
