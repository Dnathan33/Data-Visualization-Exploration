So I have been so busy lately that I haven't been able to make a post about my first trip New York City! The city was absolutely incredible. I was there for StrawHats auditions at Pace University and ended up getting 9 callbacks which is crazy! I finally got to see my first Broadway show with the extremely gifted Jessie Mueller. Me and my dad stayed at the Hotel Edison in Time Square and it was literally something out of a movie. It was such a great experience and I think that it solidified my ambitions of moving there after I graduateðŸ˜Š #newyork  #waitress #brooklynbridge #broadway #timessquare
