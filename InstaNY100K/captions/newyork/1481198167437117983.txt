Choos with a View. It's this kinda misty spring morning in New York City today. Kind of easy to keep your eyes focused on sidestepping the puddles and weaving through the crowds. But look up and you catch the wonder of the skyline where anything is possible. Yes, I love New York. | Photo: @daverobbinsphotography | Event: @chandelierevent | View: @andaz | Shoes: @jimmychoo | #wedding #weddings #weddingshoes #heels #skyline #empirestatebuilding #newyork #concretejunglewheredreamsaremade #iloveny #nyc #lookup #inspiration #picoftheday #photography #weddingphotography #makeithappen #chandelierevent
