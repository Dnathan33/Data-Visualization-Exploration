This is the kinda shit that scares the living hell out of me. I am sure this gentleman was a good employee, descent citizen, loving father. I am not sure what circumstances in life made him at 52 years old look for a job but I am sure that at this age he would much rather be spending time with his spouse traveling, enjoying his kids but instead he is looking for a $650/w job, slightly above minimum wage, to provide for himself and his family. You cannot cheat the grind, period. You will bust your ass now or later, it is it is.  Delayed gratification is a thing, do not overlook it. Do what people are not willing to do now, so you can live the life people cannot live later. The earlier you start the soon you will be well situated. If you are looking for a job or a career change contact me 914.414.2322 I will be able to help you.  Look, I don't care if you work with me or elsewhere. Just do something NOW that you future self will be thankful. I'll gladly review your resume (deniteamwolf@gmail.com) even if you want to apply for a job that has nothing to do with me, I just want you all to do good. There's enough money and opportunity out there for everyone. Let's get this shit!
