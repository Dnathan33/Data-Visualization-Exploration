There’s ample choice for Indian cuisine in Dubai, but it’s not easy to find that one which gives you dishes with a twist. I tried Peppermill in Dubai Festival City, and it was delish! We started off with some Soup, the Chaat platter, and those crispy Kataifi Prawns. With every crunchy bite, every item will transform your taste buds and take down a journey through Colonial India. Following the starters, we tried the tandoori and some curries, all of had a burst of amazing spices. The mocktails we ordered were made of fresh fruits and the service was great, lets not forget the amazing view facing the light and water show for entertainment.
