A sketchy pull today, but I'm very proud of it because I didn't think I could get it off the ground initatially! The hitch really kills me but thinking about the fact that I have time to fix my technique and I have never touched 545. I'm incredibly motivated and shoutout to my training partner @cpt_flexalot for pushing your boy despite being to different types of lifters. Take the good with the bad just keep rolling! @bigpanda323 @supportmilitarymuscle @esmietee @gaglionestrength @jorge_ruthlesspowerlifting  @apemanstrong  #strong #pullsumoeatbutt #hiphinge #kc #losangeles #newyork #miami #lasvegas #liftheavy #apemanstrong #powerlifting #powerlifter
