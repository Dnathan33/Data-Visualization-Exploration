Georgia was standing in the middle of a road in the country side late at night when several cars nearly hit her! The driver of a vehicle promptly stopped, picked her up, and rushed home with the 6 month old puppy in poor condition! Abandoned in Navarro county. A place that's been notorious for dog abuse, neglect and animal fighting. Georgia was in the right place at the right time. The finder reached out to Rescue Dogs Rock NYC and we have taken sweet Georgia into our care! But we need your help!
