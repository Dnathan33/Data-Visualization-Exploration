I am officially at the half way mark of my 12 week challenge and down a total of 15lbs.  Had to do the Monday weigh in on a tuesday since I was traveling yesterday.  My starting weight was 242lbs, last week I weighed in at 228,  just got off the scale and I am now at 227lbs.  Shout out to @kettlebellkitchen for the healthy meals and @lurongliving for the amazing supplements.  #SeeYouInJuly . . . .  #Crossfit #paleo #fitness #Fitnesschallenge #90daysoffitness #mindovermatter #12weekchallenge #week7 #kettlebellkitchen #Tuesday #whatchmework #spring #lowereastside #newyork #weightloss #summer2017 #instagood #love #picoftheday #lurong #lurongliving #cleaneating #eatcleantraindirty
