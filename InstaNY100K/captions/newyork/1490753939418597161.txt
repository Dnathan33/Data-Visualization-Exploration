Well the 2017 NHL Playoff match ups are set. Little disappointed that a few teams didn't get to meet in the first round but love that so many canadian teams have a chance to progress. Would have loved to see Edmonton and Calgary meet up for the battle of Alberta.... and Toronto vs either the Habs or Ottawa would have been exciting. Regardless... Excited to see that puck drop. Let's Go Habs!! Who are you cheering for? #nhl #playoffs #hockey #chicago #nashville #minnisota #stlouis #anaheim #calgary #edmonton #sanjose #montrel #newyork #ottawa #boston #washington #toronto #pittsburgh #columbus #leafs #habs #stanleycup #lordstanley
