New product! Julien Braud Forty Ounce Muscadet Sevre-et-Maine.  This cuvee comes primarily from terroirs seated on gneiss rock, which gives wines its fruitiness early on. A small part also comes from Amphibolite (type of rocks),which contributes a citrus and fresh mouthfeel. https://goo.gl/9mTKH6 #wine #whitewine #julienbraud #muscadet #fortyounce #cuvee #brooklyn #newyork #williamsburg #dewinespot #winesake
