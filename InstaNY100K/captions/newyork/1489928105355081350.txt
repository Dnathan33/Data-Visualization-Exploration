We are proud to announce that a number of our clients landed on the list of the “World’s 50 Best Restaurants” for 2017! @lebernardinny made the list, along with Blue Hills at Stone Barn (who made a big jump from last year, going from spot 48 up to 11), and @cosmenyc, who is making their debut on the list at number 40! The list, which has gained notoriety since its initial release in 2002, resonates with diners throughout the world. Congratulations to all on this honor!  #Dining #FineDining #NewYork #EatLocal #Restaurants #GreatClients
