"I am motivated by the young women who look up to me---most importantly the young women of color. I remember when I won, I received a lot of messages, some saying ' OMG @missusa looks like me!' So I try my best to be a representation of women from all over the world who are hunting to represent beauty. I try everything I can in terms of styling myself. It's not always about wearing tight clothes or showing some skin. But also, about showing how sexy it can be to cover up sometimes. Anytime I can, I wear baggy clothing and draw my inspiration from 90s fashion☺️."
