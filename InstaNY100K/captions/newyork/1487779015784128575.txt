Seated figure of American author and arts patron Gertrude Stain (1874-1946) by sculptor Jo Davidson. Installed in 1992, this casting is based on a model made by Jo Davidson (1883â€“1952) in Paris in 1923. Its proximity to the New York Public Library reflects Steinâ€™s significant literary contributionsâ€”from plays, librettos, and film scripts to biographies, autobiographies, lectures, essays, poems, and novels. #nyc #newyork #newyorkcityarhitecture #newyorkcity #newyorkcitylife #gertrudestein #poet #poetry #newyorkphotographer #newyorkpubliclibrary #filmscripts #biography #essay #sculpture #sculptor #jodavidson #parisðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
