Because I'm a designer, I'm drawn to the colors and movement of the fabric. As I noticed the fabric has the undeniable shape of the Mother Land,  my eyes settled on the deep complexion of the beautiful black woman. Now I'm inclined to reflect on the beauty of this life I've been given, rather than the woes I experience in my living. With all that's going on,  I needed to be reminded how awesome it is to be BLACK. âœŠ #artisanexpressionoflife  #luxury #wardobe #stylist #music #video #magazine #model #film #photography #party #events #hollywood #beverlyhills #losangeles #nyc #newyork #london #paris #miami #capetown #southafrica  #live #love #create #editorial #style #ootd
