Happy Monday & Happy 5 year Anniversary to BPM!!!! Tonight we eat, drink and most importantly WE DANCE!!! Each and every Monday from 5-11 even though the flyer says 10 it just gets so good that we keep it going. How nostalgic is it that the address is 303 S Michigan Ave, Kenilworth NJ. Y'all remember BPM Sundays at 303 Lounge! Well that feeling is back..... uninterrupted HOUSE MUSIC for 6 hours straight! Come get some! Free admission with specials all night.  @gavelstonebarandgrill @gavelstonerock @gavelstone_jess @gavelstone_mary #thedjbeloved #thelamorngroup #kcmanagement #thebpmexperienceparty #savvymarketing #housemusic #newjersey #newyork #philly #dancemusic #BPMmondaymixer #afterworkparty #pioneerdj #rekordbox #globalsoul
