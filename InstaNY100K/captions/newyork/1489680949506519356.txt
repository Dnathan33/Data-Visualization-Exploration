Looking forward to what comes next. NYC was too big for this west coast girl but who knows what other opportunities are out there. I just won't think too much about it for the next 27 days until graduation... What? Who said 27 days? Wasn't me cause I'm definitely not counting. I won't be a college graduate in four weeks. What! Psssssh. Nope. #nyc #brooklynbridge #newyork #westcoastgirl #pdx #pnwisbest #collegegraduate #27days #cantwait  #westcoast > #eastcoast #everytime #ğŸ“¸ @tateke11ey
