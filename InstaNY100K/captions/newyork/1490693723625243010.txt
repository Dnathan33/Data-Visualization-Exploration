BOYCOTT United Airlines they get the Least Friendly Airline Award. 🥇 We have choices and your airline is not mine.  I can't fly with this kind of uncertainty and violence after dealing with TSA and stupid bag searches to inspect my toothpaste and dirty laundry. 😡😡 looking forward to the end of this terrible company. People PAY for your service if you need seats stop overbooking. You pay to leave 4 seats for YOUR crew, Don't inconvenience me for your failure to plan. ✈️✈️✈️😤Who treats old people like this and he is a doctor.  #boycottunitedairlines #money #unitedairlines #spiritairlines #frontier #southwestairlines #boycott #unitedairlines #news #unitedstates #asian #bullylife #atlanta #losangeles #newyork #trending
