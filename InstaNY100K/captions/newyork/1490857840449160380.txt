my #transformationtuesday features my other 🏡 @evolutionmuaythainyc ,Ive been on my #fitnessjourney for about 2 years now. I started with #stronglifts & running as progressed more was added. Ive bounced around #martialarts prior but this place is different, my friends train here and the people who i met on the mat are amazing. You have to love where you are putting the hours in. I see the place often but I've never really looked and its beautiful 😍  @nobe_creative #photography #fightfam #fightphotography #fitnessmotivation #blackandwhitephotography #blackandwhite #family #fitness #fitnessfam #muaythai #muaythaiphotography #muaythaitraining #brazilianjiujitsu #bjj #mmatraining #judo #wrestling #grappling #striking #elbowslikerazors #newyork #nyc #newyorkcity #nycphotography
