Real Estate - In Mind Domino, 2017  In mind marks a new era of Real Estate, one which proves to be very promising. “Darling” is an obvious highlight in audio and video form. Real Estate’s familiar Euphoric highs can be felt on tracks like “Stained Glass”, “Two Arrows”, and “White Light”. Retro vibes ensue on “Holding Pattern”, while “Diamond Eye” recalls early Grateful Dead. Thematically the song seems to be about resistance to forces that divide, a call for remembering what unites us.  7/10 @ciaranpuente
