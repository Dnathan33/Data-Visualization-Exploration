Sometimes in life, there will be gaps. You may not see the ground on the other end of the hole, but it's always there. The only way to cross these gaps is by taking a leap of faith. God doesn't always show us the path as clear as we may like, but it's because He wants us to trust Him and rely on His plan for our lives. Gods plan > my plan or yours. . . . #GodIsGood #Snow #Sign #NewYork #Vacation #Memories #Hike #Adventure #FunTimes #Photography #NikonPhotography
