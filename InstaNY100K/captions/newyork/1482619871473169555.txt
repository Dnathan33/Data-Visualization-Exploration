"We had a fundamental belief that doing it right the first time was going to be easier than having to go back and fix it. And I cannot say strongly enough that the repercussions of that attitude are staggering. I've seen them again and again throughout my business life." - Steve Job - @iapple #leaderslead #hoopscreatinghope #chennai
