I Cant believe it's been almost a year since my first fitness photoshoot. So much has happened since starting this journey. If you had told me a year ago I'd be modeling in NYC I would have thought you were crazy! Have enough courage and faith to go after what makes you happy. Thank you @noeldaganta for these amazing photos
