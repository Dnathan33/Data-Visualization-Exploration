I just feel like smiling this morning. Teeth cleaning today went well, as you can see. üòÜ Had to switch up my dental office because I felt my old dentist was good, but his office lacked in the preventive care area. It is of extreme importance that I receive at least the minimum care that my insurance covers. I pride myself and my employer when it comes to our dental insurance. AT&T employees have one of the best dental plans around. I'll be dammed if I receive less than what is covered. Needless to say, I'm on top of ensuring things are done correctly and within a timely professional manner. I'm practically shining again. üòÅ (smile) It's TGIF! Have an awesome weekend everyone.  #TheDashShow #GQ #Dental #TeethCleaning #TGIF #BroSki #LoveIsLove #iDecided #BigSmile #Smile #Yolo #Pepsi #NewYork #NewJersey #SixFlags #Atlanta #Chicago #ChrisBrown #Shining #BigSean
