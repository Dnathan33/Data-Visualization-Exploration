Isn't it expensive enough living in the state of New York. New York taxes, just when you thought it couldn't get any worse. A last minute budget negotiation late Friday pretty much ensures that New York will be the first state to offer ‘tuition-free’ public higher education to its entitled snowflakes.  The $163 billion state budget agreement includes the Excelsior Scholarship, which covers tuition for any New Yorker accepted to one of the state’s community colleges or four-year universities, provided their family earns less than $125,000 a year. (The outcome, NY will lose more residents and tax revanue.) 4/10/17 #ny #newyork #news #college #education #economics #economy #free #econ #opportunity #millennials
