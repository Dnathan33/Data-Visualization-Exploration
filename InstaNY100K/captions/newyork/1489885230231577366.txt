Walk in the Light While There is Light  Chess pieces and creatures of Frankenstein  Casted my eyes aside and found the light  Sealed the evil and caused a scandal  Many and unspecified sounded freedom of speech  Glimmering, glimmering I’d just seen Was happiness when I didn’t regard you mine  I just wanna get your spirit connected with mine  I pray to get our lives to be almighty I just wanted to get my spirit find the words to mean -  Hey - true  Walk in the light  While there is the light  I was riding on the back seat of the car when I returned I saw that you and me were sitting in the middle of tram.  Got through the warfare and accepted somebody’s mind  In the deeper river, they will be in the shiver  There was some noise going in the downstair I didn’t like to think that we’re living in the mad world  I just wanna get your spirit connected with mine  I pray to get our lives to be almighty I just wanted to get my spirit find the words to mean -  Hey - true  Walk in the light  While there is the light  #rock #london #singer #songwriter  #grunge #alternative #light #happiness #life #almighty  #true #cotedazur #nice #paris #berlin #moscow #oslo #bergen #stockholm #helsinki #saintpetersburg #reykjavik #copenhagen #lyrics #vancouver #newyork #sanfrancisco #california #seattle #scotland
