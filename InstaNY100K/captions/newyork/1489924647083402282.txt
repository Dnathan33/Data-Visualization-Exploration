Good Morning Inspiration:🙏💆We are a greater society when we recognize the contribution of everyone however small it may be. This quote would have been PERFECT if it said "old men and women" or "old people" instead of just "old men". I say this because women do plant trees and make investments that benefit the future of their great grand children as well. We should also recognize the key message here; which is the power of choice. Whatever we chose to accumulate and conserve today becomes our tomorrow. So good habits will lead us to a better future and bad habits will maintain or worsen  our current struggles. So let us develop and maintain habits that benefit our health, wealth, love life, and ultimately our happiness. Let us also develop habits that benefit society as a whole. I hope everyone had a great weekend and I wish you all a happy and productive week in whatever you decide to do!! Enjoy this beautiful day!! #peace 🙏 🌞🔥🌞🔥🌞 #ewillie  _________________________________  #monday #goodmorning #inspiration #newyork #motivation #love #joy #tree #dedication #meditation #play #life #tea #lifestyle #yoga #calm #happy  #music  #fitness #food #poetry #work #vegan #workout #vegetarian #song  #instagram #instamood
