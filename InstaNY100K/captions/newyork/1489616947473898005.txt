After Taylor Swift transitioned to pop, I wonder what she did with all her cowgirl boots. Tell me what you think down in the comments below. She had so many! I miss her curly hair and her old style, but she grew to up and changed her look. This look is a representation of her new phase. Regardless of the phases she'll go through, she's still going to be an icon. She will go down in history. @taylorswift @taylornation @scott.borchetta #taylurking #taylorswift #taylorswift13 #taylornation #taylor #music #musicians #inspire #pop #countrygirl #countrymusic #popmusic #nashville #nashvilletn #newyork #newyorkcity #newyorknewyork #losangeles #losangelesca #california #cali #socal
