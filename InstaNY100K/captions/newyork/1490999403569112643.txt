One of several images based on The Crucible by my student Patti Hazlett. I am so proud of my class, every student was included in the show, Beautiful Losers! I plan to go back with a good camera and will post more work soon.  #art #fineart #illustration #sva #junior #year #student #competition #show #chelsea #newyork #nyc #schoolofvisualarts #pictorialproblems #woodcut
