Fear kills growth. Accept who you are and what you are passionate about. Do not let negative people guide your life and tell you who you should be. The fear of what people think of you can only push YOU back from your goals. Stop hanging around people who don't support you. Stay positive. Keep working and growing. #motivationalquotes #keepyourheadup #staywoke #staypositive #dreams #passion #music #art #artist #montreal #newyork #miami #losangeles #toronto #garyvaynerchuk #positivity #love
