Priceless.... . What a priceless image looks like.... . Something I could never put a dollar amount on.... . This image was shared by and belongs to @strikeq . Sometimes the work or things we do today seem to have little or no value in the present.... . Sometimes it takes time to understand and appreciate the true value, the true purpose of our work.... . Every picture we take is a time capsule and images we take today may mean nothing, but it can mean everything in the future... . This picture is priceless .... and at the time it was taken, it was just a nice picture .... And now it has become something more than the original intention of the photograph ....It's now a powerful reminder of how things were, so we can greater appreciate our past so that we can make a better future for all.... . I'm so thankful I stumbled upon @strikeq ... Thank you for sharing your work... .
