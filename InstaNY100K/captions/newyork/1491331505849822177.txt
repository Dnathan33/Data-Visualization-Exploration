He does not set out to be a leader, but becomes one by the equality of his action and the integrity of his intent.  #spiritual  #spiritualgrowth  #thirdeye  #awakening  #dreamcatcher  #motivated  #istanbul  #taksim  #morocco  #adventure  #luxury  #traveler  #spain  #brazil  #england  #london  #canada  #poland  #bosnia  #luxurylife  #holland  #newyork  #bali  #india  #life  #america  #kazakhstan  #oslo  #mexico
