Have you heard of the vagus nerve? Well it's the nerve that runs through your heart, guts and brain so when you experience a type of trauma your entire body is directly affected. “If these sensations last long enough, your whole brain starts fighting against emotions. And what happens in the long range is that traumatized people who continuously have a state of heartbreak and gut wrenching feelings learn to shut off the sensations in their bodies. And they go through life not feeling their physical presence.” -Bessel van der Kolk //
