My generation has only known war. Baby boomers shout, "These generation needs a war!" We've been fighting and dying for them since 2001. Fighting and dying for millionaires, for Democrats who are too inept to stand up against it, for Republicans and their voters who are driven by anger and happily devour misinformation. We've lived through two stolen elections. This isn't democracy. This is a plutocracy where the poor and middle class have no voice. From this day I am an anarchist. This system doesn't work. These people are disgusting. I will not die for this facade of a democracy. I am completely ashamed to be an American.
