Maikel Franco's first dinger of the season is basically the only positive as the Phillies pitching of Bucholz, Morgan, Rodriguez, and Gomez prove that they could give up a home run to a 5 year old and still get paid good money for it. Lucas Duda hit 2 out, Cespedes hit 3 out, d'Arnaud and Cabrera hit 1 out each, and I probably forgot some. Overall a complete dumpster fire, see ya tomorrow for game 3. #phils #phillies #phila #philadelphia #mlb #baseball #garbage #thephaithful #mets #newyork #ny
