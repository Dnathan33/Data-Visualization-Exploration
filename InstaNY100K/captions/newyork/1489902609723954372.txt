On the Jewish holiday of Passover it is prohibited to eat chametz/leaven. On the morning prior the holiday, all leftover leaven food are burned and nullified in a cermony. According to Kabbalistic teachings, the chametz/leaven represents the bad habits and traits that a person is trying to rid of. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------During the ceremony the following prayer is recite, "All leaven and anything leavened that is in my possession, whether I have seen it or not, whether I have observed it or not, whether I have removed it or not, shall be considered nullified and ownerless as the dust of the earth".
