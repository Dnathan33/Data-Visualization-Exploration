Here's a unilateral leg exercise routine that's essential for anybody, athlete, mother, father, whoever! Not everyone may be to do all of these exercises of course do to various body ailments, balance, weakness or unfamiliarity, but there a steps that can be taken to properly progress towards doing so. Do not try these, expect maybe the single leg bridges if you've never done so before. It's not worth injuring yourself while trying to build yourself up!  For those who can, try 2-4 sets of 10-15 depending on if you're looking to build some strength or endurance. Later today I'll explain the importance of isolating the oposite sides of the body when exercising.  #PositiveMindFitness #PMF #WorkoutOfTheDay #Fitness #Friday #Health #StatenIsland #NewYorkCity #NY #NewYork #PersonalTraining #LegDay
