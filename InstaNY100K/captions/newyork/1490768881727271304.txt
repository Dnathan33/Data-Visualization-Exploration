Remo cleaning his sister's feet. No one taught him how to behave with the new puppy but he has been so gentle and sleeps right in front of the bassinet checking every little sound she makes. Love you nut job. #nationalpetday #belgianmalinois #landshark #siblings #brooklyn #malinois #malinoisofinstagram #newyork
