People are going to think what they want to think. I let them. You can’t control perception. It’s a losing game so I don’t play. I let them lose; lose themselves in their own fantasies of what they want me to be. A rebel, an angel, a romantic, a heart breaker, a boy, a man. Perhaps I am all of those things. Perhaps I’m none. But what I am is for me to find out, not to be dictated to me. It’s for me to know. 🙏👏🙏 _____________________ #ballet #balletboy #jump#malemodel #maledancer #quotes #sytycd #photoshoot #photosession #betm#enb#fitness#gym#muscle#splitleap #dancersofig #dancersofinstagram #worldwideballet #worldwidedance #newyork#joffreyballet #states#
