Larry Bell's Pacific Red II in B&W. • While this work has some of the most beautiful tints and shades of red I have ever seen, photographing this installation in B&W brought out its delicate transparency, starkness and interplay of figures in the grid. • Bell, considered a founder of the California Light and Space movement, lives and works between LA & Taos. • Throughout his career Bell has investigated the properties of light on glass. By experimenting with the nature of surface and its relationship to space, Bell has devised a methodology characterised by spontaneity, intuition and improvisation. • This work is a welcomed sight at the #whitneybiennial2017, located on the sixth floor, outdoor courtyard. • Photos by @heather.teets • • #newyorkseries #newyorksojourn #newyork #whitneymuseum #renzopiano #meatpackingdistrict #thehighline #westvillagelife #gansevoort #bw #blackandwhitephotography #streetphoto_bw #streetscene #streetphotography #streetphotographer #larrybell #installationart
