04.04.2014  MARIO FRANGOULIS  San Francisco Debut at Nourse Auditorium, 4/4 BY SEAN MARTINFIELD ‚ÄúI love San Francisco. It has a pioneering spirit and unique culture of openness that makes its doors open for everyone. Being born in Africa, raised in Greece and having lived all over the world, I believe in the richness that diversity brings to society. This is why I love to sing in many languages‚Ä¶ a language embodies a culture and I have learned so much about the world through my music and through singing in different languages. San Francisco has this kind of spirit for me‚Ä¶‚Äù said @mariofrangoulis  Poster edited by @sahrakaran  #certificateofhonor #mayor #sanfrancisco #2014 #mariofrangoulis #MARIOFRANGOULIS2017 #LIFE #DREAM #PEACE #international#greek #tenor #mariofrangoulis #positivethinking #love #compassion  #greeceüá¨üá∑#athens #world #refugees #mission #future #believeinpeople #determination #focus #togetherness #music #newyork #boston
