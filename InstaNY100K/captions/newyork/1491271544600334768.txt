I took this picture in New York, the first time I visited this amazing city in 2014 ðŸ–¤ Somehow today I miss it. I miss the Art you can breathe in almost every street, the buildings, the people, the style. I miss the chaos, the grit, the contrasts. The music, the speed, the height, the light ðŸ–¤ Hope I can see you again soon one day, NYC ðŸ–¤ #aldraws #traveldeeper #newyork
