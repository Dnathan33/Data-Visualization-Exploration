In a new book, “Pablo Escobar In Fraganti,” Escobar, who lives under the pseudonym, Juan Sebastián Marroquín, explains his “father worked for the CIA selling cocaine to finance the fight against Communism in Central America.” “The drug business is very different than what we dreamed,” he continues. “What the CIA was doing was buying the controls to get the drug into their country and getting a wonderful deal.” “He did not make the money alone,” Marroquín elaborated in an interview, “but with US agencies that allowed him access to this money. He had direct relations with the CIA.” Notably, Marroquín added, “the person who sold the most drugs to the CIA was Pablo Escobar.” #drugs #government #cia #help #ghetto #blackmen #philly #cali #la #newyork #artlife #design #homelife #drugs #molly #perk #cocain #dope #heroine #hustlers #atlanta
