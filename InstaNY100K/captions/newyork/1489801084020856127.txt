Part of Vietnam War. American B-52 bombers reportedly begin bombing North Vietnam on April , 10, 1972.The bombers struck in the vicinity of Vinh, 145 miles north of the Demilitarized Zone. It was later acknowledged publicly that target priority during these attacks had been given to SAM-2 missile sites, which had made raids over North Vietnam increasingly hazardous. U.S. officials called Hanoi’s SAM-2 defenses “the most sophisticated air defenses in the history of air warfare.” These defenses consisted of advanced radar and lethally accurate air defense missiles. #vietnam #vietnam🇻🇳 #vietnamese #laos #vietcong #usa #usarmy #usairforce #navy #usnavy #unitedstates #coldwar #saigon #hanoi #dalat #hochiminh #hollywood #newyork #lasvegas #washington #florida #texas #chicago #arizona #oklahoma #kansas #newjersey #honolulu #california
