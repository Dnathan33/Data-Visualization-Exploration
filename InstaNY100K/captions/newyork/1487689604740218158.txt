If it means selling fruits in the cold so be it. I see more then just a street vendor pushing dollars and coins at 4:30 in the morning.  He had time to chill and think and to think and chill to also make money at the same time is more then what most have.  Stay woke and keep awareness. #newyorkcity #awareness #photography #newyorker #newyork #streets #fruits #lights #vendor #Manhattan
