Finally getting the chance to sit down and review this Bourbon so graciously bestowed upon me by @taconic_distillery A straight Bourbon with a mash of 70% corn, 25% Rye and 5% barley,  3 of 1014. Upon, popping the cork I was greeted with a pleasantly sweet nose, actually with some orchard fruit hitting me first (nectarines came to mind). In the glass, the whiskey is vibrant and fresh, with vanilla, toffee, hints of butterscotch candy. On the palate the whiskey is light-bodied, there is more vanilla, caramel, charred oak,  light honey. The finish  is invitingly cozy, with the vanilla really sticking. I've said it before, for a younger, whiskey this has a lot going for it. I fell in love when I was first introduced to @taconic_distillery and every time I try one of their expressions I am blown away. Keep up the great work guys! #thewhiskyobsessor #whiskygram #instawhisky #instagood #bourbon #bourbongram #instabourbon #americanwhiskey #corn #rye #barley #newyorkwhiskey #newyork #whiskey #whisky #whiskylife #thanks #loveit #mypassion #taconicdistillery #abvnetworkcrew #value
