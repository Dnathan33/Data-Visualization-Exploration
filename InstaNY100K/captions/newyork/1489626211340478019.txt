"Now you've seen his face. And you know that there's a place, In the sun, For all that you've done, For you and your children. No longer shall you need. You always wanted to believe, Just ask and you'll receive, Beyond your wildest dreams." #devotchka #nyc #ny #newyorkcity #newyork #newyorknewyork #manhattan
