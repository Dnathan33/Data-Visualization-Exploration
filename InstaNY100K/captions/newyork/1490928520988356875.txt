A piece of Ellis Island history in TriBeCa. French street artist JR did 1900s archival photo of children waylaid at Ellis Island, on the side of 100 Franklin St. The photo is an homage to the storied entryway into the U.S. of immigrants.  #newyorknewyork #tribeca #newyork #nyloveyou #newyorkcity #iloveny #Charmnyc #Charmnewyork
