Deconstructed apartment painting still in progress. It's a grey wet day outside so it's nice to retreat into my own attic studio world to explore extraordinary worlds in my head and onto canvas. I've been using this Mahl stick now for about 25 years and some of my brushes were my grandfather's.  Lovely to feel that continuity in a painting that's all about change. #art #cool #music #urbanism #City #sky #CultCinema #style #urban #oilpainting #Surrealist #artdirector #Comicbook #movies #graphicnovel #popsurrealism #invention #architecture #love #construction #rooftops #artist #painting #amazing #LAart #1960s #newyork #artoninstagram
