It was 16:49 on Jan. 24th in Tokyo. . The sunset time was getting closer, and I saw the timing of it indirectly by the reflections of the sunlight on the windows of these buildings. . It's impressive though these buildings are perfectly artificial things, they are well affected by some natural elements such as sunlight, clouds or rain. . . #instagram #instalove #instagood #instamood #instapic #instagramers #instafashion #boston #madrid #frankfurt #zurich #stmoritz #losangeles #newyork #nyc #nairobi #switzerland #kenya #カメラ好きな人と繋がりたい #東京カメラ部 #ファインダー越しの私の世界 #travelphotography #traveling #Tokyo  #ana #dreaming_adventures #spain #germany #Switzerland #livetheadventure
