SO, we have A LOT of bonded kitties who need foster homes/ to be adopted together. I know, taking in two cats seems like a lot. But the fact that they have one another can actually ease anxiety and make transitioning into a new environment easier! Please, please, please! We need some homes for these kitties, even if it's only temporary.
