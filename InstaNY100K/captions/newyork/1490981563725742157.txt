Beautiful Chloe has a heart of gold and when you spend quiet time with her, she instantly connects. Chloe desperately needs our help to find a new foster because the resident little dogs can't handle her playful and sometimes clumsy ways and that makes her sad and frustrated. She played with dogs at the dog park just great, but these little grumpies mean she has to be gated away from the rest of the family! What Chloe needs and craves is to belong, to cuddle and feel love from her human family and probably should be the only dog, or perhaps one other very patient and playful dog may work. She does have some special needs as a result of a serious injury in her very young life, but if you think you may be able to help this girl find her happy place, please let us know and we'll share more about her. She is 36lbs, 10 month old lab/lab mix and she has so much love to give!! Apply to Foster or adopt: rescuedogsrocknyc.org  #rescuedogsrocknyc #ChloeRDRNYC #adoptdontshop #RDRNYC
