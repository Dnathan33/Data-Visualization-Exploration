#BlackGirlJoy 🤗. Tonight was the quintessential #NewYork night. Met my girls @moniquebrob & @steffyfullstyle up at the @shrineharlem , got to surprise and hear my sista @storm_marrero sang her face off. 😳👏🏽💃🏽 Had dinner, desert, and THEN ended up catching a late show where we discovered new artist @rob_clove and jammed until way past midnight! 💞🎶 My feet and body are tired, but my heart and spirit are oh so full. 😌💞 Simply put, I got my entire life tonight, chile.  Thank you, New York, for reminding me of all the reasons why, even though you work my nerve sometimes, you are an awesome, beautiful, and inspiring city. 😌💞 #SoMuchYes #Gratitude #LiveMusic #NewYorkLive #TravelinGirl
