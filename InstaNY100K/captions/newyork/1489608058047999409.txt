I leave #nyc over and over and it never leaves me. I snuck in less than 24 hours for a visit. But I feel like I never left. Every single time I walk through these streets at night, I'm reminded that it's the only home I've ever had.  It was good to see you @jeffreyeh & I can't wait to start another music project with you in the summer.  #newyork #brooklyn #queens #newyorkcity #travel #wander #vagabond #wanderer #wanderlust #womenwithtattoos #bqe
