Started exploring the High Line from the Whitney Museum (which was unfortunately closed on Tuesdays) side at Gansevoort St. This 2km+ long outdoor urban park is on a disused elevated section of the New York Central Railroad spur called the West Side Line. Runs through Chelsea, all the way to 34th St. One can enjoy on a relaxed pace, soaking in art installations, exhibits, architecture - the concrete and brick structures on both sides, with peek-a-boo views of the Hudson River. The Statue of Liberty also makes an appearance albeit quite far. I can imagine the greenery once it's full spring or summer. Lucky New Yorkers, they can sunbathe, read a book or simply enjoy the view as the entire line is dotted with lounge chairs and benches. I'd love to go back and do just that. ðŸ˜Š#solotravel â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ #TravelerInNewYork #NewYork #NYC #TheHighLine #streetsign #FifthAvenue #travel #travelgram #instatravel #instaplace #travelphotography #beautifuldestinations #wanderlust #ImaLoveWorkTravelMagnet #WanderWoman917 #TravelJunkie #passionpassport
