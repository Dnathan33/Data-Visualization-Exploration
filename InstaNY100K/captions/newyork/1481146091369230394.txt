We met with Mr Toshiki Fujimori, a survivor of the bombing of Hiroshima. Here is part of the testimony he gave to the United Nations earlier this week. "I was 1 year and 4 months-old when the bomb was dropped... I had my entire body covered with bandages, with only my eyes, nose, and mouth uncovered. Everybody thought I would die over time. Yet, I survived. It is a miracle. I am here at the UN, asking for an abolition of nuclear weapons. I am convinced that this is a mission I am given as a survivor of the atomic-bomb.  Two hundred and ten thousand people died by the end of 1945 due to the atomic bombs the U.S. forces dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Hibakusha experienced hell on earth beneath the mushroom clouds. In fact, Hibakusha have continued to suffer for the 26,166 days until today... Nobody, in any country, deserves seeing the same hell on earth again.  Every year, on August 6th, my mother would gather all of us children and would talk to us about her experience in tears. I once asked my mother why she would speak about it if recalling the experience makes her suffer. 'I can't make you go through the same experience.' That was her answer.  Her tears were her heartfelt appeal. She called, as a mother, for a world with no more hell on earth." #quakers #unitednations #nuclearban #newyork #hiroshima
