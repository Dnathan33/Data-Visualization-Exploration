First hike of they year! It was too nice to stay inside and train today. Plus I'm running on 4 hours of sleep so it probably would have been a lackluster training day anyways. Can't even describe how good it feels to be outside in the sun.  #hiking #adirondacks #adk #newyork #outdoors #strongman #fitness
