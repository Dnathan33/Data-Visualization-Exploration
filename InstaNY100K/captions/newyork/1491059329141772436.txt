The menu description for the Opera Cake at @unionfare reads "chocolate mousseline/hazelnut joconde/cardamom ice cream." They did not mention anything about the stupendous birds' nest of a dome (made from solidified caramel) that covered the cake when it was brought to the table. I guess the candle was just for effect but it was also perfect for the occasion. My friend Julie and I started celebrating our birthdays together (we're both born in April) as Peace Corps volunteers and have continued the tradition since coming home. Union Fare was this year's pick for our birthday dinner. #dessert #sweet #sweets #cake #food #foodporn #instafood #yummy #restaurant #unionsquare #flatiron #manhattan #newyorkcity #newyork #nyc #iloveny
