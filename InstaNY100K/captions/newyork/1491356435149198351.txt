Can't wait to be back in New York in 12 days and eat all the top scran and catch up with friends.  Not had a chance to go back since I was there in November for the #UFC205 what a night that was! Probably going to be staying in Brooklyn again but will be about Manhattan a lot as well so if anyone's up for food and drinks lemme know!  #newyork #brooklyn #manhattan @robertboydholbrook
