When the scale finally moves 🙌🏻🙌🏻. I been up and down between 186 and 184 for the past month. It's so frustrating and annoying UGH ! But I have definitely noticed the difference this week. First, I been counting my calories - a lot of people believe that eating healthier foods is better but sometimes forget to look at the portion or carbs. I have been writing everything down which ends up amazing me. Something as healthy as a banana as a shit ton of carbs. Second - I been working out every single day for the last week. I made a promise to myself to go at least 5 times a week and I have. Thank you Jesus ! Nothing is more frustrating then putting in work and not seeing results. 2 pounds down 42 more to go. 🙌🏻👏🏻🙏🏻💪🏻 #jujuxfit#julianasweightlossjourney#nyc#newyorkcity#newyork#fitnessjourney#fitness#weightloss#health#healthy#fitbit#fitbitflex2#vsg#vsgsurgery#vsgjourney#vsg#vsgcommunity#gastricsleeve#gastricsleevesurgery#gastricsleevecommunity#julianasfooddiary#foodlog
