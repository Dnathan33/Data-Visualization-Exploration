Tugs, airplanes and New York City fire boats are saluting the Normandie as she arrives in New York, the final destination of her maiden voyage in June 1935. The ship made the crossing in 4 days, 3 hours and 14 minutes at an average speed of 30 knots, as such, she broke the record hold by the Bremen and won the Blue Ribbon. #oceanliner #ssnormandie #history #travel #artdeco #ship #1930s #newyork #blueribbon
