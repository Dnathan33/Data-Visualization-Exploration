While I spend one more day in the city, I wanted to leave you with a lovely snapshot into the wonderful Alternative Flower Accessories workshop taught by the magnificent Mel of @properflower & her awesome assistant Ashlee. The work that came out of that class was stunning ~ bracelet cuffs, garlands, barrettes, tiny bouquets, necklaces & many, many happy faces. I'll be back tomorrow to share the highlights of our beautiful Brooklyn weekend! . @sweetpaulmagazine #sweetpaulmakerie2017 #sweetpaulmakerie #brooklyn #newyork #creative #creativity #handmade #connection #community #flowers #floraldesign #properflower #beauty #beautiful
