“Fig.7 The Midwife” - From the ‘Saving Washington’ exhibition, currently running at the New York Historical Society Museum.  This series of portraits of women personifying roles in the history of America, were produced as hand illustrated, traditional style line and wash drawings. These were then superimposed over digital settings.
