Sunday and #Monday are traditionally stylist days off...yesterday, I worked on a very special wedding💍 booked with me over a year out. I'm completely booked today (by choice)...I have my coffee🍵, the sun🌞 is finally out in the Hudson Valley🌽, and my week behind the chair is looking amazing!  #lovethisshit #imfocusedman #findthepositives #happyMonday✂❤✂😉
