I want to give a #happybirthday #shoutout to @missdiva19877, my longtime #longdistancefriend from #syracuse #newyork, who I've known since 2008 from the last good years of MySpace, back when she was singing and i was rapping. She's even modeled a few times. Ruth has always been one of the most #important but also one of the most #realfriends I've ever known. Yes she's been a #crush of mine, and has been #wcw a few times (yes my #latina fetish, esp #boricuas is mad crazy ðŸ˜‚), but I'll always love her for being supportive of ours lives, even if we don't talk much now a days, and I'm glad that's she's a #mother of 3 now (1 son born last year, current #pregnant with 2 twins daughters). #loveyou always #amiga
