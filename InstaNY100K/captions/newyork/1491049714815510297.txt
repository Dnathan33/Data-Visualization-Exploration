I love exploring foreign countries but I can do without the flying (being trapped in small confined spaces is not fun at all 😵). Flight delays are common but what happened to the Asian doctor on the United flight a few days ago was absolutely unacceptable. 😡 I will never fly United ever again! #unitedairlines #laguadiaairport #newyork #newyorkstate #nightsky #flying #aerialview #airport #laguardia #empirestate #boycottunited #boycottunitedairlines #travelaroundtheworld #trip #unitedstatesofamerica #usa #美國 #紐約 #紐約市 #newyorkcity #bridge #高空 #birdseyeview #米国 #飛機場 #旅遊 #wanderlust #夜景 #aerialphoto
