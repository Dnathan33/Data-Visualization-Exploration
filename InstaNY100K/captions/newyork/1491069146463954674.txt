Wherever you go, ask God for wisdom on how to get that Gospel in, even in the toughest situations of life" . . . ___________________________________ #photooftheday #picoftheday #photo #photographer #vibes #art #fashion #design #filming #film #filmmaking #creative #music #video #vision #light #people #newyork #manhattan #action #streetphotography #blackandwhite #bnw  #bnw_captures #blackandwhitephotography #monochrome #world
