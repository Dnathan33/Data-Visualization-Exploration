Who else is wondering why @therock needs bodyguards 😌.. He is simply amazing, taking always time for his loyal fans. As you can see on the picture, he enjoys spending time with them and appreciate every single one 👏🏽! ⭐️⭐️⭐️ @alpha_tony_ got the chance to take a nice shot with @therock and his one million dollar smile 🕶.. This is what Tony has to say about his idol: "Meeting the rock was like meeting an icon of motivation in the fitness industry. The rock is one badass son of bi***. I can tell because the guy is built like mountain. I grew up watching the rock from watching wrestling to his movies and seeing his Instagram working out makes me wanna reach to the next level. His motivation on Instagram makes me wanna hit the gym harder and harder and push my body to limit. The rock is on a another level. Badass motherf***** on the planet 💪💪" ⭐️⭐️⭐️ ✨✨Tag @therock ✨✨ ⭐️⭐️⭐️ #celebrity #celebrities #dwaynejohnson #therock #actor #gq #model #funny #strong #motivation #inspiration #muscle #amazing #smile #great #personality #kevinhart #buddy #ny #newyork #loyal #fan #jumanji #fastandfurious #movie
