Totally forgot about posting something about my New York City trip on throwback thursday, which is why I declare today to be my NYC throwback friday! To start with - We stayed in Brooklyn with a friend which loves Rock'nRoll as much as I do, which can be clearly seen just peeking at his place. Loved staying there and occasionally make some music when recovering from sightseeing. ðŸŽ¶ #newyork#jammin#nyc#travel#guitar#music#musiclover#rocknroll#potd#picoftheday#instadaily#instagood#instalove#welovenyc#brooklyn
