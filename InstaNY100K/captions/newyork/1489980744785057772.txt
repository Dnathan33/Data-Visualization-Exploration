A modern duplex was created inside this Pre-War building on Madison Avenue. D’Aquino Monaco’s design approach sought to remove any pre-conceived notion one might have of an interior space in a building of this design. An open floor plan was chosen over a series of formal rooms to allow for effortless entertaining throughout the main spaces. A sculptural stair which takes design cues from Fontana Arte leads to the second floor lounge and wrap around terrace. Simplicity of form and finishes allowed modern artwork to take center stage.#RenotalConstruction #renotal #construction #contractor #jobsite #projectmanagementprofessional #consulting #management #development #beautiful #glam #lovely #instalike #sweet #fashion #style #beauty #elegance #pretty #trend #interiordesign #decoration #decor #newyork #NYC #luxury #architecture #satisfying #redecorationideas #interior
