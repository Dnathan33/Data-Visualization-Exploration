SORRY FOR THE CAPS, TODAY WAS AN AMAZING DAY I JUST CANT COMPLAIN I KNOW IVE POSTED SO MUCH BUT THIS MEANS THE WORLD TO ME EVER SINCE I WATCHED HOME ALONE... ITS BEEN MY DREAM TO COME TO THE BIG APPLE üçé... I IMAGINED IT DAY AND NIGHT... I REMEMBER GOING ON GOOGLE MAPS AND JUST GOING PLACES AND PRETENDING I WAS HERE! BUT I AM HERE AND I COULD NOT BE ANY HAPPIER THAN THIS!! THIS CITY IS SOMETHING I HAVE ALWAYS FANTASIZED ABOUT AND THANKS TO MY MAMA I GOT HERE!! THANKS TO MY FRIENDS AS WELL BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS TOLD ME THINGS ARE POSSIBLE! THEY ARE AND I FOUND OUT IT IS AND THINGS CAN ALWAYS HAPPEN WITH EFFORT!! üèô #blessing #trip #dream #hope #newyork #stay #wish #chill
