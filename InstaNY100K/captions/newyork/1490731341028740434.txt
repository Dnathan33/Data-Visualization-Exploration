Are you seeing it now? I'll keep posting examples if you don't. The Democrats, The GOP, the corporations, the banks, these are the ONLY "humans" who will win if we keep up these wars. They win in the form of personal monetary gains at the expense of OUR lives. As we collectively start to come together to say no more, they will fight back. A former soldier who fought for our country and current congress member, a woman who's dedicated her life to her country, @tulsigabbard is being attacked for calling out the establishment on their true intentions. She is being targeted by her own party for telling the truth. Corporations are fighting back. Ima put this next part in caps, but I'm not yelling at you, I'm simply putting the obvious in bigger print: THE ONLY WAY WE STOP THE ENDLESS SUFFERING OF OURSELVES AND THOSE WHOM OUR LEADERS DEEM BOMB-ABLE, IS TO COME TOGETHER, ALL DAMN SIDES, AND SAY NO MORE. It's the only hope we have. ❤️✌🏻✌🏼✌🏽✌🏾✌🏿❤️ #blacklivesmatter #translivesmatter #lgbtqlivesmatter #nodapl #waterislife #UnitedAirlines #draftbernie #notmeus #ourrevolution #theresistance #newyork #newyorkcity #neworleans #ferguson #baltimore #chicago #losangeles
