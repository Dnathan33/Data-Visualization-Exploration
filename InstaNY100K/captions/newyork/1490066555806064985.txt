Today I am working on a new set of vestibular treatment exercises. Unfortunately, these exercises send numerous neural signals to my brain with messages telling my brain to PANIC and that I am in DANGER.  I'm not in danger, but as I complete my exercises I aggravate the neurons memory of my injuries. The neurons panic and send messages of pain to my brain. The neurons will continue to send messages of pain until I am able to desensitize my neuron's response to my bodies movement.  In time, I will desensitize my nerves and be able to move my head freely without my neurons sending messages to my brain that I am in danger and pain. - - - #physiotherapy #neurology #concussion #whiplash #caraccident #advocate #doctors
