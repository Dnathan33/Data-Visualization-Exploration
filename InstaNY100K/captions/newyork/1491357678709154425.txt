Bow Bridge, Central Park ❤️ being in New York really was just a completely amazing experience. It really was everything I wanted and more, the five year wait was so god damn worth it! It was a feeling that I can't describe, and looking back at my photos makes me so beyond happy. Everyone keeps saying "don't you want to go somewhere else?" but the answer is no. The love I have for New York, the way I felt, the atmosphere (even when walking alone at midnight) was perfect. I love New York, hopefully I'll be back in 2018 and FINALLY see snow! #newyork #newyorkcity #bowbridge #centralpark
