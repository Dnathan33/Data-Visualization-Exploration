This morning I headed over to meet @corinne_drysdale_cheeses at the Drysdale Cheese Farmgate. I met Letitia the beautiful Saanen goat & the rest of her buddies that will be featuring in my fashion shoot alongside model @tayahgreen (shoot postponed until May) 💃🏼💗 If you would like to see the organisation progress of this photoshoot & pics of these cuties then check out my @sophiaharrisonstylist account where I post all my fashion editorials 🌈😝
