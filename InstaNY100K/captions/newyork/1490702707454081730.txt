I spent most of last week feeling blah and it 100% had to do with my lack of working out. I finally had the opportunity to work out Friday though and I left feeling less stressed, more confident and lighter. It's amazing what fitness can do for you! I'm so excited about this warm weather and yesterday I played tennis with my bf after work. So excited for more outdoor activities, but also excited to be spending more time in @sasstudiony 💕☀️🎾🙆🏼
