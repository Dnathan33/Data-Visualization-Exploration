It's been 11 months to the day since I moved to NY, and now it's time to go. Never thought I'd love it here as much as I have, thanks to all of the wonderful people I've met and the amazing places I've been. I will miss it dearly here, but New Hampshire, here I come! #moving #newyork #ny #newhampshire #travel #graduation #throwback #hudsonvalley #proud2bcia #culinaryinstituteofamerica #collegegrad #movingon #travel #picoftheday #texan #friends
