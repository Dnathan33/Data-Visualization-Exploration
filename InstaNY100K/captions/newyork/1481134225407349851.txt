Today's thought. People confuse pity and empathy. Pity is when you look down on someone because you can never see yourself in their position. Empathy is when you can easily see yourself or loved one in that position. I don't care who you are or how much money you make. Everyone on earth is one ALS, dementia, or leukemia diagnosis away from bankruptcy,  even Bill Gates. Something to think about for certain people when they talk about health care or the national budget.  Looking at you, Congress and that vile little national budget director who said that he was cutting a school breakfast program for poor kids because the kids weren't doing any better in school because of it.
