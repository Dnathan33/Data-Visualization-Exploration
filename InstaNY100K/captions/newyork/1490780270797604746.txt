#Repost @unclesamsmisguidedchildren with @repostapp ・・・ #Snowflakes need to quit worrying about #WWIII. Sometimes we have to break some 59 #Tomahawks to make an omelet. We are not going to get invaded that's for sure. We have the largest unorganized , most unruly , undisciplined #UncleSamsMisguidedChildren #army in the world. First our invaders will have to face our #rednecks and #hillbillies , and then they will have to deal with inner city problems. I mean who would be crazy to invade #Chicago? Or #Detroit? Screw that, even #Miami would be out of the question having to deal with a bunch of scar faces with #machineguns and then you have to take #Texas, we know how that is  going to work out for them. #NewYork Mob or #Philly , how about #ChinaTown? We have more guns in #America than #China and #Russia combined who are accounted for, lest not talk about the ones they don't know about. You don't even need to worry about #California, they have a dozen #MarineCorps Bases even their own #Marine Corps #bootcamp with a thousand belligerent Hollywood #millennials, and good luck with the #NavySeals training Facility. We are the only few countries who still have Native Indians and they aren't going to give up their casinos without a fight.  To top it all, let's not even bother with #Area51, no one wants to mess with our pet aliens. And if they drop a bomb you wont feel a thing.  #Mad Dog #JamesMATTIS has Fire Watch! And At least we have a President #DonaldTrump who will answer the phone at 3 am in the morning. (As you can see I didn't even mentioned our full Military power which is the best fighting force this world has ever seeing) even our snowflakes will smack our enemies with their dildos. So guys, sleep like babies tonight. Rick Ferran #USMC
