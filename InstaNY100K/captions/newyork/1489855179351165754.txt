Today i showed @lengbespoke my design for a new suit featuring a generous notch lapel that will span 11.5cm and has an unusual shape where it meets the collar. Something inspired by a berluti overcoat i saw. As always leng is not afraid to tell me when things wont work and so we fought over a few details - some which leng said were too 'fashion' . The bow tie was a gift from a friend of mine at hermes and it was nice to wear another brand for a change.
