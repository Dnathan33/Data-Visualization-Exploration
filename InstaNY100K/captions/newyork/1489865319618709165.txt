Hi guys! A new video is up on my youtube channel. The link is in the bio! In today's video, I am talking about everything you need to know about applying to the US- college deadlines, application process, visa appointments, how much work experience you can get, temporary work visas, student visa laws and lots more! Even if you aren't planning to go to the US, please share this video with someone who may need the help  Please do give it a thumbs up and share the video if you liked it! :) Oh, and subscribe to the channel as well if you would like to follow me on this journey!
