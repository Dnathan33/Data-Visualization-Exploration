This takes a few weeks, and then the gorge will be open to the public for the season.  #SenecaLake #WatkinsGlen #FingerLakes #NewYork #ILoveNewYork #ILoveNY #Adventure #Explore #Hostel #HostelLife #Travel #Travellife #BudgetTravel #BudgetÂ  #StayAtTheLocal #Vacation #Memories #WatkinsGlenStatePark #FingerLakesWineTrail #WeekendGetaway #BeerAndWine #HostelTravel #instatravel #TravelMore #NewBusiness #AroundTheWorld #Smallbusinessowner #TryNewThings #ExploreMore
