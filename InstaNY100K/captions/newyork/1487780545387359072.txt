A question for you all on this fabulous Friday.  I hear so many talk about how they are willing to be in Love, but let's face it, Love doesn't always live next door.  I'm such an LA girl, yet, for some reason the universe keeps attracting me to souls from the Midwest, where i grew up and it can get very cold.
