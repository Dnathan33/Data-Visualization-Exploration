New York was beautiful üòç and had some really great stuff to see over there for my one day stop at New York. I have safely reached North Carolina and going through some crazy jet lag and hopefully I have a great SUP session tomorrow. A big thanks to @aprilzilg for giving me this opportunity to come over here and participate in the @supcarolinacup. A big thank you to all who have supported me so far ‚ò∫ #gratitude #newyork #northcarolina #USA #Lovingit #traveldeeper #iamatraveler #dametraveller #India #sup #SUPsurf #adventuremore #adventurebetter #femmetravel #CNTGiveItAShot #exploretocreate #roamtheplanet #destinationnext #mystories #indiatravelgram #indiansupergirl
