Hi traveling friends and fellow lovers of snail mail! I want to send 100 postcards and cards this year. (And hopefully receive some too!) A little twist on a 100 day project. So, I have two asks: 1. If you travel often and would like to swap postcards from our adventures, let me know.  2. If you get mail from me this year (even if you have already) send me a pic! It can be of just the card: front or back, or you with it! I'm starting an instagram to document my 100 postcards challenge! Follow along @hundred_snails 🐌💌📬🗺 #travel #mail #postcards #cards #letters #send #traveller #passport #international #snailmail #paris #london #nyc #newyork #nashville #greece #atlanta #japan #saopaulo #penpal #100dayproject
