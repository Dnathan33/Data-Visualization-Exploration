Don't aaaaask! We are just calling this my way back Wednesday. The only thing darker than my eye was my hair. Thought long and hard if I would ever share this, but it is a memory and the only proof I have that I was not always grey lol...... Sometimes in life it takes a few bumps and bruises to get where you are going in life. Shit happens.
