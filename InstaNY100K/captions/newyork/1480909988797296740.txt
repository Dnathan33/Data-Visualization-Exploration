New York you had it last year and it sold out in five days.  Well, now Los Angeles is getting the Museum of Ice Cream and its going to be 4x bigger than the one in #nyc and tickets go on sale April 3, 2017 - $29.00 Adults $18.00 for children and seniors.  Forget everything Nietzsche ever said—God is alive and well, and we have the evidence to prove it. And by proof of the existence of God, we obviously mean an opening date (at long last!) for L.A.'s highly anticipated Museum of Ice Cream. Yes, a museum of ICE CREAM.  After an extremely hyped, limited run in New York last summer (30,000 tickets sold out in five days) the Museum of Ice Cream will be making its way to Los Angeles this April. This is their second location.  The Museum of Ice Cream, according to our sister site Gothamist in New York, "is a museum only in the loosest sense of the word." Think of it more like an eminently Instagrammable, real life Willy Wonka dreamscape of ice cream-themed art and spectacle. The L.A. location will be FOUR times larger than the New York City incarnation (sorry Rotten Apple, but West Coast is the best coast) and will have 10 completely reimagined installations.  Tickets go on sale April 3 at 9 a.m. PST for the general public.  Your links:  http://laist.com/2017/03/28/the_forthcoming_la_museum_of_ice_cr.php#photo-21  M.o I.C. : ://www.museumoficecream.com
