Easy on Monday Morning. ☀️Weekend: trauma informed yoga training was more than I could ever imagined. My heart is so full. It's so important to do the things that ground you. Whether it's yoga, writing or being in nature (a few of the things I do for self care) it's important to always make your well being a priority. I learned a loving kindness mediation which can be similar to positive affirmations. Take a chance each morning to say "I am happy, I am healthy, I am me" with your breath & see where it can take you. ⚡️
