I can't believe I did this shoot four years ago right before I moved to #newyork I had no idea what life was going to throw at me after I made the commitment to a new life style. Living in a Miami mindset & transitioning into a New York State of mind was like doing a 360. Although I'm not where I want to be, I'm grateful for the obstacles I've endured & for the people I've connected with along the way #miamilove #newyorklove ðŸ’–ðŸŒ´ðŸ—½
