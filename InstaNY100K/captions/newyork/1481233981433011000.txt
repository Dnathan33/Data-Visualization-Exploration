Lévy Gorvy is delighted to present 'Diane Arbus: In the Park' a solo exhibition of Arbus' iconic New York park photographs from May 2 through June 24 in New York. - “… I remember one summer I worked a lot in Washington Square Park. It must have been about 1966. The park was divided. It has these walks, sort of like a sunburst, and there were these territories staked out. There were young hippie junkies down one row. There were lesbians down another, really tough amazingly hard-core lesbians. And in the middle were winos. They were like the first echelon and the girls who came from the Bronx to become hippies would have to sleep with the winos to get to sit on the other part with the junkie hippies. It was really remarkable. And I found it very scary…There were days I just couldn’t work there and then there were days I could…. I got to know a few of them. I hung around a lot… I was very keen to get close to them, so I had to ask to photograph them.” -Diane Arbus - #comingsoon #DianeArbus #Arbus #newyork #photography #parks #LévyGorvy #LévyGorvyGallery #LevyGorvy #LevyGorvyGallery - Diane Arbus 'Two friends in the park, N.Y.C. 1965' © The Estate of Diane Arbus
