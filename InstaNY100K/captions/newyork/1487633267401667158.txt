Good morning! Isaiah 53:7 says, â€œHe was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his mouth." This is a prophecy of our Savior, Jesus Christ . He is why we can be saved and filled with the power of God today. His great love wherewith he loved us, brought us, mankind and God, together. I'm so grateful for His sacrifice He made for ALL. Hallelujah! Glory to His matchless name!
