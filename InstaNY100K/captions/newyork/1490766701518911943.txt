You have made it happen before, when you've really wanted it to. You have seen the power of what you can do when you've set your mind and soul to it. And you have attracted what you have needed when you have needed it. It's no different this time; you're not stuck, you're not confused and you're not off track. You're the most on-path you have ever been in your life. Keep focusing on your outcome and ride this uncomfortable part out. It's all so close to falling into place. âœ¨ðŸŒ™ Wise words via @colettewerden // model @anyakadyrova / make-up by @shirleyjaymakeupartistry #rafaellafedrigo #editorial #centralpark #nyc
