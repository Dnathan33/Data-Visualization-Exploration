At all stages of life we must come to the conclusion when realizing self has outgrown the elements and it's time to push through. Don't allow the fear of the unknown or the emotions of the past keep you away from understanding the gifts of the future waiting ahead. Yes this isn't what was expected but yet always needed in a time of growth. Not all will understand your process and methods of healing towards self and the universe but continue to grow as one INSIDE & OUT. 👳🏾📿🐍👁🕴🏾👨🏾‍🎨🌊🏄🏾🌊 #x170konscioussociety #artwork #stars #kemet #space #art #spraypaint #spraypaintart #cltartist #charlotte #noda #artcollection #work #paint #dopeart #atlantaart #newyork #angel #africa #47thkhamber #supportblackart #blackart #blackartist #supportblackbusiness #selfmade #locs #loner #hippy #cosmos #galaxy
