Good morning! It's been a looong 7 days, and I'm finally feeling well enough to head back to work. 💪 Looking forward to it, and to catching more beautiful, Springtime, NYC scenes, like this! 😊👍 Have a great Wednesday, all! . . . #BryantPark #BryantParkNYC #NYCParks #Spring #Springtime #Flowers #Daffodils #FlowerGram #Carousel #HappyKids #NY #NYC #NewYork #NewYorkCity #Manhattan #Midtown #BigApple #ILoveNY #ILoveNewYork #ILoveSpring #ILoveNYC #ILoveNewYorkCity #TNYR #ABC7NY #NewYorker #IG_Color #BeautifulDestinations #BeautifulMatters #NYCToBeacon #BeaconTransplant
