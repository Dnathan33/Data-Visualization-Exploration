For anyone into #streetart or #murals or just #art, check out the #stunning #nyc #wallart Called #urbanmythology at #houston and the #bowery  Here's just a tiny square of the giant wall. Look close, look far, but #checkitout before it's gone.  #nofilter #noedits #wildhorses #graffiti  As spring has sprung here in #newyork, walk around. And maybe think about the fact 2016 is the hottest year on record, and we're probably going towards another record. This is not mythology -- the earth is changing. Support public spaces, support green energy, and let's all do our part. Organizations like @nrdc_org or @worldhealthorg @amnestyusa @saveourseasfoundation are involved in various aspects of #climatechange, cleanup, stewardship, regulatory issues or the very real issues of impacted citizens who need help. Take a deep breath, and enjoy life, but remember that the warm sun on our faces is trapped by greenhouse gases. To keep our earth sustainable and green and inhabitable, we all have to lend a hand.
