How do you take a milkshake beyond 'plain, boring and unexciting'? We went looking out for unique milkshakes in our favorite cities San Francisco and New York and boy, did we love what we found! In SF, the beautiful @burgerbarsf overlooking Union Square serves the most indulgent milkshakes in a variety of flavors. We chose an 'adult' milkshake in the Red Velvet flavor - a concoction of red velvet vodka, vanilla ice cream, chocolate syrup, cream and cherries. Way to add a punch to your everyday milkshake! In NYC, @newterritoriesny has taken milkshakes up a notch with their unique designs (yes, milkshake designs are now a thing!). If you don't believe us, check out the picture of the most good-lookin' milkshake we've come across. Called 'Unicorn Parade', it is a cocktail of ube, vanilla bean ice-cream, sprinkles, marshmallows, pocky, cream and fruit pebbles dust. Both these milkshakes are definitely bringing us to their yard!
