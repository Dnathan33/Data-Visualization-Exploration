As a landscape painter, it is imperative to respond to nature- to feel it and experience it resonating in the soul. Develop a love and respect for the earth, changing seasons, and the quiet yet awesome power of the universe around us; as well as the infinitely detailed world- from the floating dust in the sunbeam, the glitter of snow in moonlight...to the smell of electricity as a storm approachesâ€¦  There is no better place to find solace than in the lap of tranquility offered by the gentle ocean tide." If you're around the NY area, I am going to be teaching a Saturday class, starting April 15, 10:00- 1:00, plein air!
