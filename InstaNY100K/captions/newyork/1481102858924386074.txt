All the #red all the #viviennewestwood 😍❤💋👠💄 This time in 2 weeks I'll be in #NYC. It's all getting so #real the last few weeks have been such an emotional roller coaster and it's still going. For anybody who says a #crewmember is just a #trollydolly I'm saying we are trained to save your life in numerous situations. We are trained to get you off an air craft in 90 seconds in an emergency. We are trained to deliver a baby on an aircraft and to help make a heart beat again when it stops. I can honestly say I've never been tested as much as I have the last month. I've worked hard for this. In my early 20s I was in a controlling relationship for several years and was unable to be myself or go anywhere without a heavy weight hanging over me. I'm finally doing something for me. Overcoming my fears and experiencing life fully. Saying yes. So yes I'm steps away from a set of #wings and working for the best UK AIRLINE. I will remain creative and can only know in my heart this is gifting me life skills so valuable to acting. I havnt given up. I'm only just starting. #adventure #wings #newbeginnings #fly #red #love #redhead #viviennewestwood #ginger #newyork #world 🌍🌎🌏 #cabincrew #virginatlantic #virgincrew #airhostess #trollydolly #travel  #traveltheworld
