#Repost @adaatude ・・・ Ok so this IS my first pair of "rain boots" and I have to say I am in love with them! They're waterproof street art rain boots & the artist that is featured on them is JPO, named by MTV as one of the top 6 street artists and selected to create a special mural on the Lower East Side of New York City for the announcement of Drakes MTV Video Music Award nomination.  JPO has also been featured on ABC and he's basically a badass. This isn't a sponsored post. I just like to share some serious badassery and incredible art. You can find more about JPO on his Insta (@jpoart) 🎨 What do you think of these ankle rain boots? 👢❤️ #nbarainboots  #jpo #notkansas rainboots by @hollenbergbros  #styleblogger #blogger #fashionstyle #rainboots #jpoart #rain#streetstyle #nyc #tbt #newyorkcity #newyork #rainydays #rainraingoaway #rainydayoutfit
