One of several images based on The Fall of The House of Usher by my student Mary Searles. So many good paintings, probably my favorite detail.  am so proud of my class, every student was included in the show, Beautiful Losers! I plan to go back with a good camera and will post more work soon.  #art #fineart #illustration #sva #junior #year #student #competition #show #chelsea #newyork #nyc #schoolofvisualarts #pictorialproblems #gouache
