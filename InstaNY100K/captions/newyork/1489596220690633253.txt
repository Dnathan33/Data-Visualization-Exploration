It's been an emotional night for me and probably for the other fans as well. The Steven McDonald Extra Effort Award was presented. This was the first year without his presence. But we all know that even without his presence, his legacy has impacted us all and will forever live on. 🙏 Congrats to Zuccarello on being named the winner as this 2016-2017 winner. Mats sure have deserved it. ❤🎉#nyr #nyrangers #newyorkrangers #blueshirt #blueshirts #blueshirtsunited #blueshirtsnation #blueshirtsproud #rangerstown #nyr90 #ny #newyorkcity #newyork #nyc #manhattan #msg #madisonsquaregarden #nhl #nationalhockeyleague #pushfortheplayoffs #pittsburghpenguins #togetherweare104 #stevenmcdonald #nypd #magnushellberg #ryanmcdonagh #derekstepan #jimmyvesey #pushfortheplayoffs
