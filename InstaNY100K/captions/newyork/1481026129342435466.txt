HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY BEST FRIEND. Brother, we really have been through it and you have been there for me at my darkest times weather you have realized it or not. I'm learning so much from you as an actor and person it's ridiculous. You continue to push me and believe in me when no one does. There's just so much I could say. The amount of crazy shit we do and say is unreal. We cry together, we laugh together, we scam together. Your the definition of petty, and I'm the drama that comes along with it. This post is getting hella gay but I just want you to know I fucking love you, & beyond proud. Can't wait to see you shine in your lead role this year in Devil's Whisper. Keep shining. üåä‚ô†Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
