#Rehearsal #Studio #Progress report (and a little peek at the #floorplan ðŸ˜‰) -- Studio 5 is closer and closer to a finished product, every day... then we get to focus on the main course in our #rehearsalstudio buffet, Studio 6:  over 2000 sq. ft. of #spring laden #hardwood floors and a full wall of #mirrors for the #dancers at your #dance #rehearsals.  if you look top left and bottom right, you can also see the new attached #production #office for each studio.  the possibilities are endless!  #CarrollMusic #ny #BlvdPro #nj / #nyc #new #rehearsal #studios -#biggest complex in #newyork #audio #NewYorkCity #backline #gear #rental
