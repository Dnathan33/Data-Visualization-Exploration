I Love New York!  So happy that NY just made college tuition free not only for two-year public schools but for 4 year public colleges too!  Education is so important & so many students who thought they would never go to college because they can't afford it, will.  Amazing. #iloveny #nyc #newyork #cityofdreams #dreams #opportunity #newyorkcity #education #educationiskey #success #college #free #amazing #love
