I always try to limit the gear on engagement shoots, forces me move and be more creative in compositions. I brought the Leica M10 with the 50mm and the Canon 5DMk4 with the 24mm Tiltshift. Plus the Mavic Pro for a few shots. What's your favorite 2 lenses to bring on a shoot? @leicacamerausa @twistedoaksstudio . . . . . . . . . . . . . #hudsonriver #constitutionmarsh #newyork #newyorkphotographer #weddingphotography #weddingphotographer #engaged #engagement #engagementphotos #gameoftones #phillyweddingphotographer #leica #leicam #leicaðŸ”´ #leicam10 #canon #tiltshift #5dmarkiv #ase #alienskinexposure @leica_camera @canonusa #huffpostgram #huffpostido #constitutionmarsh
