Post workout bathroom selfie! I was absolutely DRENCHED and dead tired! Did #FBG lifting week 3 Legs then did an @aaptiv workout of 16-200m sprints. HOLY SHIT. That was harder than running 10 miles straight. I'm dead, done, exhausted! After the gym, I went grocery shopping and got all of the healthy foods. Recently, I have been snacking WAY too much and I know it's really hurting my progress. I workout way to hard to let my bored eating get in the way. So, I'm going back to writing down everything that goes in my mouth! I'm allowing myself 3 meals a day and 2 snacks! When I lift in the am, I will allow myself a little protein/fuel before the gym. I'm ready to stop making excuses with food and start seeing results! Plus, summer is coming!
