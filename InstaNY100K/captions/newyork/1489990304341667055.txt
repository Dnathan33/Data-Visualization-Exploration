The new World Trade 1 tower stands as the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, thanks, in large part, to the 400 ft. spire/antenna, bringing it to a symbolic 1,776 ft. in height...................Reviews of the building have been mixed, with general 'not too bad', comments.  In a strangely ironic twist, the architect of the original Twin Towers, Minoru Yamasaki, (died 1986), wrote a response to those critical of his bold 1960's-70's design, which was only recently made public.  In the letter, he defended his use of narrow-slit windows, offering small and partial views, and believed that the day of the all -glass skyscraper was 'finished'. ......... "As for mirror glass, I detest it, because buildings with it look to me as if they have cataracts, showing no live (life) within. On the interior, it produces strange reflections of lights, objects and people which gives me a feeling I can only describe as eerie." Were Mr. Yamasaki to return to 21st Century, downtown New York and view the replacement to his beloved World Trade Center, an 'eerie' feeling might be the least and mildest of his professional and emotional responses.  Those born before the 1990's, will never forget.
