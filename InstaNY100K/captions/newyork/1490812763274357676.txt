Discomfort or pain - feeling uncomfortable in our skin or some health scare- can be great motivators to get us started on a fitness journey. They help us to get up early, train, tolerate discomfort,  discipline ourselves and give us momentum to shift our lives toward something that we desire more; health, fitness, strength and feeling empowered.  Even thou fear and pain are great to get us moving, when they keep running the show our lives become full of anxiety, stressed and imbalanced.  This is why I recommend you to switch your motivation onto LOVE .  The difference between the two paths is the experience itself, and we don't just want to lose weight to look good, but we want to feel fulfilled and happy. Our body is a vehicle and an expression of that.  Love your body enough to eat clean...don't just do it to lose weight.  Love your body enough to train and become strong.  Love yourself enough to want to be your best.  Weight loss from love is about gaining balance and healing. Don't let fear cloud your journey.  Knowing how your journey changes by your intention: which one will you choose Love or Fear?  Remember it is a choice you make, choose wisely and consciously!
