01.21.2017 Women's March  I didn't mean to get into the protest for 1.5 hr but I still was. A lot of people showed their opinions, bravery and faith, no matter what genders were theirs. It's hard to believe that I was in the history. -- 01.21.2017 見證歷史的一刻，反川普遊行 站上街頭的人們不分性別，是為自己，也是為自己愛的人發聲。大家拿著樂器、敲打著水桶、大聲唱著屬於這個年代的激情與勇敢，這樣的曲調才是最迷人的。
