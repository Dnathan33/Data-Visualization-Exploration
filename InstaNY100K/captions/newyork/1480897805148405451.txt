Nextt is an "idea accelerator" started by @twsamph as a passion project when he was the Director of Content at @everwise. From a Fintech startup to a children's books registry, Nextt helps people take ideas from "the back of a napkin to a MVP" (Minimum Viable Product) in 8 weeks. Their approach is connecting non-technical creators to mentors and testing their ideas through rapid experiments. Thomas is also obsessed with helping people build skills in creativity because they are uniquely human. Check out our convo about Nextt with Thomas in episode 6 of #5to9podcast!
