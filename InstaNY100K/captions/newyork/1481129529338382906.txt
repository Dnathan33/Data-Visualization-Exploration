I got some BIG news to announce!  We're teaming up with music artist Andrew Patti, known as "Pattiak" through a special relationship with WrestlingNewsSource.com. Pattiak is a HUGE professional wrestling fan who was born in Long Island New York and raised in Phoenix Arizona. Pattiak blends the soul of the 90’s lyrical hip-hop and combines electronic, rock, and Midwest flare to his sound.  Pattiak’s LIVE shows are Vegas-style theatrics, giving him mass appeal to his huge fan base. Famous MC DMX quotes “Pattiak is the fastest rapper in the southwest.” But Pattiak says humbly, “It is a gift to perform double and triple time rap. You don’t see many people doing that these days.” Pattiak has performed with some of the biggest artist in the industry such as: The Game, E-40, Snoop Dogg, WC, DJ Quick, Bone Thugs n Harmony, Wu Tang, Redman, Sublime, 311, Three Six Mafia, Juicy J, Chino XL, Spice 1, Mac10, Lil John, Far East Movement, Rappin 4 Tay, Rusko, Matisyahu, Michael Franti, KMK, Slaughter House, and many more.  I encourage you to to check out his  newest track "History of Wrestling" (Rock Mix) with over 100+ references! - www.facebook.com/PattiakAssassin/videos/691620191010965/  @pattiakassassin @wrestlingnewssource #wwe #WrestleMania #hiphop #wrestling #rap #electronic #rock #newyork #longisland #arizona #thegame #snoopdogg
