After seven years of a shared love of life and one another, Jake got down on one knee and asked me to marry him.  It all started with a business trip….I was in New York for a business trip and I had been working Wednesday through Friday. My plan was to stay through the weekend and visit my oldest friend who lives in Brooklyn. Throughout the week, Jake and I had been in contact, but he explained how busy he was with work. The work week concluded on Friday and my dear friend and I were off to play in NY. Saturday morning she mentioned she had a surprise planned for me in the evening, but that we’d first walk through Brooklyn Bridge Park. I was excited because I had seen it in photos and thought the view was breathtaking. She told me to make sure I felt pretty because we were doing something really special. Upon arriving at Brooklyn Bridge Park, we soaked in the view; it was the most beautiful day. The sky was grey and it was windy, but with the skyline of Manhattan in the background, it was postcard-esk. After about twenty minutes of walking, we arrived at Pier 2. I posed in front of the skyline for a photo, and suddenly, from behind a wall, Jake walks out.  I was speechless, shocked, stunned. He takes my hand and makes his promises, explaining how much he and our relationship mean to him, and then he gets down on one knee and pulls out of his pocket the most stunning and perfect ring. I immediately say yes and the crowd around us cheers. Our journey of love continues... . . . . . #weddingphotographer #wedding #engaged #photo #love #sandiego #newyork #sdwedding #love #weddingideas #weddingplanning #proposalstories #theknot #theknotrings #proposal #vendors
