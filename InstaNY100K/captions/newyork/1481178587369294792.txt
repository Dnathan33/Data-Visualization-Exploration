The New York Times : "Albanian Joan of Arc" Handsome heroine takes fathers place and vanquished Turks. May, 21 1911 --------------------------------- "Physically the Albanian are the finest race in Europe. [...] The first time I saw the Albanians walk it gave me just the same pleasure. Their movements are so graceful, elegance and strength together". "Yes, they are a very fine and a very gifted race. They are like the Scots in the seventeenth century, and they will be by and by the finest race, intellectually as well as physically, in the Balkans". ------------------------------------------------------ "If you go to Constantinople you will find that many of the finest men, not only soldiers, but also statesmen, are Albanians". ------------------------------------------------------ http://article.archive.nytimes.com/1911/05/21/104825658.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJBTN455PTTBQQNRQ&Expires=1490790592&Signature=z8UwwvWzz9zVp2IlVDn4u0FiTk0%3D ________________________________________________________ thenewyorktimes #nytimes #albania #albanianpeople #handsome #beautiful #shqip #article #quotesoftheday #newyork #thealbanian #ancientorigins #autochtone
