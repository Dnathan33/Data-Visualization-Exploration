At the home of the whimsical and wise photographers Yva Momatiuk and John Eastcott. (Photo is theirs and for more go to cloudscloudsclouds.com) they have spent 40 adventurous years together climbing mountains, camping out, wading in icy waters and exploring this beautiful earth for just the right image. And their rare love story is authentic to be sure, their home testament of their curiosity, travels, warmth, and creativity. #artist #globalcitizen #globalnomads #photography #photographer #artwork #inspired #inspiration #inspire #newyork #hudsonvalley
