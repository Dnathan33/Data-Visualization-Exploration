GolovkinvsJacobs sells roughly 170,000 on PPV. That is 20K more than previous GGGvsLemieux. What do you think of Golovkinâ€™s PPV performance? Does it indicate that his star is steadily rising or that he may be peaking in terms of drawing power? . #GGGJacobs #GolovkinJacobs #GGG #GennadyGolovkin #DanielJacobs #TheMirackeMan #fightweek #boxeo #boxing #MadisonSquareGarden #MSG #HBO #HBOBoxing #BigDramaShow #mexicanstyle #NewYork #TheBigApple #UnivisionDeportes #TheGarden
