"Imagine there's no countries It isn't hard to do Nothing to kill or die for And no religion too Imagine all the people living life in peace, you... You may say I'm a dreamer But I'm not the only one I hope someday you'll join us And the world will be as one "👬👫👭 #imagine #johnlennon #dakotabuilding #peaceandlove #respect #newyork #manhattan #뉴욕 #맨하탄 #존경 #평화 #사랑 #희망 🙇
