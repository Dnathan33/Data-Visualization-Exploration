#Regram from @mackinnonfinefurniture . . .  We are delighted to continue our Designer Spotlight feature on the blog today with one of our favourite interior design duos, Olasky & Sinsteden.  Catherine Olasky and Max Sinsteden both have backgrounds in historic design, and their fresh take on traditional design affirms the importance of antiques in the modern home, and we can't wait to see what they will come up with next.
