This is an excerpt from todays blog- thought it might be an interesting to share part 1 about developing a visual concept from the platform of plein air painting. I am looking forward to my plein air class this Saturday. We will be enjoying some great sunshine- message me if you'd like to still be a part! It is going to be around the Long Island north shore- offered through @teachingstudios "Creating a Visual Statement: The Concept of a Landscape Painting" "Expression starts by means of impression" -I am approaching this topic from the context of Plein Air painting, since the discipline of working form life is always ideal. I am often asked "Where do I begin? There are so many choices when approaching nature." Before any project is begun, it is paramount to have a clear direction in your mind of what you imagine the canvas should look like when finished.  It’s important to find scenes that are aesthetically pleasing to the eye. I think about clearing my mind and trusting my intuition to allow it to speak to me when something strikes a chord of having that “feeling” I’m looking for.  I like to start with something that I feel would make a great center of interest.  When considering a location to paint,  I am looking for opportunities for it to feel “right” or allow yourself the freedom to judge honestly when something doesn’t feel right.  You can always move a tree!  In order to begin any task, you need a plan- a course of action. An architect would never just go buy some boards and begin throwing something together and hope for the best. I cannot underscore the validity enough of having a statement and plan in place before beginning. Know what is beautiful and what you want to say or you will never arrive at that “ah-ha!” moment!  #jessicahenry #longisland #longislandartists #newyork #newyorkartist #artists #artclasses #artworkshops #artinstruction #pleinair #outdoors #outdoorfun #outdoorpainting #oilpainting #oysterbay #blogger #blog #arboretum #dahlia #garden #art
