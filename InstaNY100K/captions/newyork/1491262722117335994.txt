I hate this part... as I drive over Whitestone Bridge with Manhattan skyline to my right.. I think to myself what a great experience it has once again been.  No matter how big a city may seem its size cannot be compared with the ocean. No matter how big your ship is, a larger one just sails by. No Matter how large the worlds seems flying over land, the land cannot be compared to what lays under the sea, and no matter how many times I visit I am always left feeling inspired. A few new faces and many more experience. #travel #vacation #usa #unitedstates #newyorkcity #newyork
