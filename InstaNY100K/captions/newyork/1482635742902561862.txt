Rainy morning NYC currently sipping on a cup of almond milk cappuccino in bed (I have my doctor's appointment is 2 hrs). Last night #s were high after my soba dinner. 3 hrs after dinner I was still 119, so I put on my sneakers and went up and down the stairs of my building till my legs were burning (which is only 8 floors) I tested again as soon as I got back and I was 88. This morning fasting #s were 87 which is interesting... does this mean I went down only by 1 point overnight? ðŸ¤” #gestationaldiabetes #pregnancyproblems #countingcarbs #diabeticmama #11weekslefttogo #newyork
