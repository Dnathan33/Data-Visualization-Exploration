Storm rolling in (part 2) So after I got to the waterfront I was able to catch the leading edge of a warm front that was moving across the island towards the sound. Though there wasn't a burst of color like I had hoped there would be after the sun went down, I waited and decided to do some long exposures. #storm #clouds #rain #longexposure #blue #sunset #sea #ocean #calm #landscape #landscapephotography #naturephotography #stonybrook #longisland #newyork #neverstopexploring #nature #naturalist #stewardship
