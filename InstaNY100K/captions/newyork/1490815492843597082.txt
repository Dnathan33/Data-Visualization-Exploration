Today is gorgeous here in #newyork!  My poor son is on day 2 of a stomach bug so we are stuck at home.  I'm making the most of it by enjoying some #reading time on the deck....in shorts and flip flops!! Just started my current book Goodbye Days by @jeffzentner.  You can check out my March reads on the blog today (link in bio) and I am joining @lifeaccordingtosteph and @saysjana #showusyourbooks link up to get lots of new reading recommendations!
