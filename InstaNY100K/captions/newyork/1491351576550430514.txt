Amazing! Spectacular! Powerful! The new beast of the Swedish manufacturer, the Agera RS1, has been finally presented at 2017 New York International Auto Show! The RS1 is powered by Koenigseggâ€™s own twin-turbocharged 5.0l V8 engine, that produces 1,360hp and 1,011 lb ft of torque in its 1MW variant. And its power is directed to the rear wheels via a 7-speed automatic transmission.
