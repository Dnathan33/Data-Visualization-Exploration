#NewYork will be the first state to make #tuition at #publiccolleges and universities free for middle-class students under a state budget approved by lawmakers Sunday.  The plan crafted by Democratic Gov. #AndrewCuomo will apply to any #NewYorkStudent whose family has an annual income of $125,000 or less. To qualify the student would have to meet certain class load and grade point average restrictions, and room and board would not be covered.  #NYnews #collegestudents #highereducation #debtfree #stayinformed #knowledgeispower #betterfuture
