Regretting the tattoo you got when you were 18 or...not quite in the right frame of mind? We can help with that! ğŸ’¥Â We use high-intensity lasers to break up the ink pigment within the skin. ğŸ’¥Â The laser uses Precision Beam Technology for accurate and consistent results. ğŸ’¥Â After a few weeks, the skin naturally re-absorbs the smaller ink particles until the tattoo is no longer visible. ğŸ’¥ Multiple sessions are needed for desired results, but noticeable changes occur after each session. ğŸ’¥ The laser will not damage the skin tissue or your chromosomes.
