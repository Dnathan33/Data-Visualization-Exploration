#fbf to when March was still a 🦁, and I got to play tour-guide for one of my fav hometown homies ✨: . Some peeps enter our lives as teachers: there to hold a mirror up and show us our blind spots; to help us shed light on areas where we try to believe we've got it together and are acting in a serving way...but in actuality we're maaaybe just trying to avoid the discomfort of #truth 🙈. . . See, when we can put #ego aside for even *a moment* and open up to lessons from loving others, there's so much we stand to learn about ourselves and our patterns. The problem is it's so natural to resist, deny, or defend the (at times sobering) #wisdom these conversations reveal. It's #vulnerable. It's challenging. It's fucking excruciating at times. But it's also an opportunity for awakening—and for ultimate healing and growth 💪🏻. . So how can one let go of ego, open up to discomfort, and recognize and explore our inevitable blind spots? 🤔 Well, the most necessary balm is #compassion for having said blind spots (and the apparent deficits awareness reveals). We ALL have them. We're ALL imperfect. We're ALL students on our own journeys, learning and healing and pivoting and iterating. So confront that shit with #love and patience and remember we're all in this together 😘. Oh, and thank yo' teachers 🙏🏻. .
