From mile marker 6, Sugarloaf Mountain. This was where I found my walking sticks and ran out of water. I should have refilled my hydration pack in the morning. The last mile was NOT fun, with a 400ft rock climb ascend and descent following this view. â€¢ #outdoors #outdoor #getoutside #getoutdoors #hiking #hikingadventures #rockclimbing #newyork #nyc #weekend #weekends #weekendgetaway #getaway #roadtrip #mountains #trail #trailrunning #travel #travelgram #fitness #fit #wilderness #wildernessculture #nature #naturewalk #sunday #sundayfunday #sundays
