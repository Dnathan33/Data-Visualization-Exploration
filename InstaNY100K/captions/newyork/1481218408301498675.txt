Life is very short. Honestly, just think about this for a moment. Think about how every day just passes you by, & when you're done doing that, then think about how we grow older every year, & wonder where the entire year went again?  If we all know this, then why would we waste a single day of our lives with someone who doesn't make us feel closer to #God? Why would we waste time on a love that we know can't benefit us in the long run? We deserve the kind of love that takes our breath away, the kind that brings tears of joy to our eyes, a flutter to our hearts, and peace to our souls, as if it was God himself/itself standing next to us. The one who makes our dreams come true. Yes that's right, all of our dreams. Mine happen to be love, kindness, peace, an amazing spiritual connection with each other and God, amazing mind blowing love making, & finally children. For I want to grow my family, and share with them my heart and my last name. Yes, I want it all, & I will have it. I know that you're out there my dear. Maybe you're reading this post right now, or maybe you're just praying to Allah, & asking him for exactly what I am asking for. After all, I just prayed and asked for these same things myself...
