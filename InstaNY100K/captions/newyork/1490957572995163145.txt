"And my problem was that I always tried to go in everyone's way but my own. I have also been called one thing and then another while no one really wished to hear what I called myself. So after years of trying to adopt the opinions of others I finally rebelled. I am an invisible man." -- Invisible Man by Ralph Ellison (@vintagebooks @randomhouse 1947/1995) // I mostly listened to the audiobook on @audible_com (narrated by Joe Morton, who was excellent especially with all the orator voices for different speeches) // but I also borrowed this copy from @haannaahhmkay because I like to be able to look back over bits, which is hard to do in audio! . . . This book is so different from any other novel I've read before. And even though it's sort of shameful that this wasn't in my high school English curriculum, I'm glad to be approaching it a little later than most people do. I feel like high-school-Anna wouldn't have been able to engage in quite the same way, if that makes sense. Coming to this book with the context of the current times obviously gives you a lot to think about, so I'd even encourage people who have read it before to give it a reread. The Joe Morton audiobook is SO GOOD even though it's like 19 hours long and took me forever to get through. But over the course of listening to this book (for over a month, oops) it was almost as if I were on this long journey with the main character, even changing as he changed, working through my angst as he worked through his. Also, seeing Get Out when I was about halfway through gave me even more to think about (there are a lot of really interesting/scary white lady characters in this book!! who interest me for obvious reasons) // This is one of those books that 100% deserves its reputation as a classic. If you haven't used audible before, I can send you the audiobook for free with your trial! :) my next audible read is going to be Trevor Noah's memoir "Born a Crime" & the physical book I'm currently reading is "Sleeping on Jupiter" by Anuradha Roy.
