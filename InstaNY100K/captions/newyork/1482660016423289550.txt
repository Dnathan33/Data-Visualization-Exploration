. day 65 of  #100daysoflipstick 💄 today i am wearing @covergirl #outlast #liquidlipstick in #deepburgundy. i wouldn't exactly call this #burgundy, ☝🏻️ but it does last all day and then some! except in the waterline. it peels away in the waterline. that is, at least the pieces that miss adhearing to my teeth. 🙄😁 this is from the double-ended collection and i prefer their original formula much more than this one. the gloss bleeds right onto my skin, but the #lippie itself stays put. what a mess the gloss part is. but all in all, i still prefer this formula to many others and for under $10, how much can i expect? 😹 i used @anastasiabeverlyhills #dipbrow in dark brown on my #eyebrows and @milanicosmetics #matte #liquideyeliner in midnight matte. this the mattest product i have ever used and i love it! it also lasts all day and night; awesome! my #electricblue #sweater is from #f21. #100daysofmakeup #instabeauty #igbeauty #redhair #browneyes #selfie #newyork #lotd #motd #lipstick #lipsticklover #lipstickaddict #lipstickjunkie #makeup #realgirl #lips #sephora @forever21
