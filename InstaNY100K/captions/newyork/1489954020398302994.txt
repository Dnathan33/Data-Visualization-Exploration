I couldn't wait for the day to end. I worked a 9 to 5 and felt cold, isolated, distant from the world. I became trapped in a world I could care less about. One day I decide I want to do more with my creativity, and one day I did, and that one day hasn't ended yet :) #vlog #vlogger #blog #blogger #newyork #cinematography #dÄ±rector #storyteller #setlife #filmmaker
