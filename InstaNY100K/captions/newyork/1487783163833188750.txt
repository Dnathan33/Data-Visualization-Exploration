ISN'T SHE BEAUTIFUL? ** JUST CLOSED ** Our latest addition to our multi family portfolio.  We just successfully removed the injunction on this property in court allowing us to purchase and save it from being DEMOLISHED!  This home was bought by an inexperienced investor that underestimated the expense and complications associated with a major rehab in this neighborhood.  We love to pick up projects less experienced investors give up on, we acquire distressed properties, rehab, stabilize & maintain the properties building our asset portfolio.  Our system allows us to provide secure (Asset Backed) double digit annual returns for both our investors & our companies building passive secure income for years to come.
