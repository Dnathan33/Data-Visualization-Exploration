Brooklyn bridge and the Manhattan skyline. Landing in JFK, we decided to go to see the skyline before heading to DC. It was an incredibly good day! Sort of feel like in a Hollywood movie as we drove into Manhattan on Brooklyn Bridge :) forgot about the tiredness from the 16-hour flight.  #KelUS2017 #newyork #newyorkcity #roadtrip #travel #brooklyn #brooklynbridge #manhattan #manhattanskyline #usa #unitedstatesofamerica
