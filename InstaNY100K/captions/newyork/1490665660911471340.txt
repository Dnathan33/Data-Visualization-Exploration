I'm sure most if not all of you have shopped at Sam's Club, BJ's, or Costco. These retailers charge a fee to become a member. In exchange, you get their savings and you get more for your money. Our loyal customer program works the same way. You can pay $50 to get the wholesale price OR you can order for 3 months and have the fee WAIVED. The awesome thing about being a loyal customer is you manage your account, you earn 10% back off your orders in perk points, you can use these points on favorites or other products you want to try, and last but NOT least, once a loyal customer always a loyal customer! You get 40% off for life!!! Too easy! Who is saying NO to saving money???? You're getting your product at MY cost!
