Sorry for the radio silence! Its been a month!  Finally, warmer weather! Although, where I live, there are no in betweens. Exactly LAST MONTH, it was 20-30 degrees. Well, last week, it was 30 degrees Fahrenheit. There is no smooth transition. Just 70 degrees straightaway! So this is where we all get sick. Im not sick YET; but I assume only a matter of time.  Leaving you with this photo of Forsythia branches (in a trash bag!) --their season will be over soon!! . . . . . . . . #FlowerObsessed #Flowers #Floraldesigner #NYFlorist #NJFlorist #flowers #events #design #floraldesign #wedding #bride #shower #noho #nyc #newyork #newyorkcity #theweekend #spring #bouquet #yellow #springbreak #springflowers #branches #nygram #thatsdarling
