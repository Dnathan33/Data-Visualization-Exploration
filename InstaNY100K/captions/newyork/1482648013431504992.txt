Today is #tdov2017 which stands for "International Trans Day of Visibility" I would like to dedicate this day to @peppermint247, the first openly #transgender contestant of @rupaulsdragrace. Letting Peppermint in the show that #rupaulsdragrace is willing to let the show move forward, and so we will have more types of drag in the show.  Thank you Peppermint. Whether you win or go home first, you have made a landmark change and #dragqueens will be forever grateful for you.  #peppermint #rpdr #RDR #dragqueens #dragaholic #dragqueen #lgbt #lgbtq #drag #makeup #fashion #trans #transwoman #rupaulsdragraceseason9 #rpdr9 #newyork #usa #america
