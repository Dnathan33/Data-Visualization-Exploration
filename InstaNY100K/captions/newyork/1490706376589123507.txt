New York is truly magical and is the most immense place I have ever visited, made even more special with the person I experienced it with...I want to say the biggest of biggest thank yous to wifey for organizing this 40th Birthday surprise....thanks to ma and pa for coming to have the kids, to J man for airport taxi.. to everyone that knew and kept it a secret.. loads of photos and highlights to come (you know me..) but one of my fave selfies... just walked over Brooklyn Bridge.... no filter needed....just look at that skyline.... #newyork #NYC #skyline #sun #Brooklyn #brooklynbridge #wifey #selfie #iphone #magical #immense #awesome #love #loveya
