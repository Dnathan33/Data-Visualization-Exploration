We're picky, creatures of routine and are comfortable in being called boring. It doesn't matter if we're in KL or London or Queenstown. It's the same everywhere, every year. We are devoutly faithful to our beloved eateries. And everytime we're in #newyorkcity we make plans to eat everything on the seasonal menu here. Because: skylights are a gateway to the stars, rustic goals and weathered walls are my aesthetic and lemon ricotta pancakes can never be kept away from me 🙌🏻💛 @instagram @thefatradish #theprettycities #newforkcity #eeeeeats #eatfamous #eatingfortheinsta #newyork #nyc
