It is so easy to sin. I sin without even thinking sometimes. But there are moments where our conscious kicks in, breaking or rebuilding what needs to be protected before you make the wrong decision. _ . I often times forget that I have to pray when I'm in these types of situations. People are very selfish living creatures. We think of ourselves first before anything. Peter for example denied Jesus three times because it was instinctive of him to protect himself from the angry people who hated Jesus. Later he wept bitterly for doing so. _ . Spiritually, we know what is right and wrong, but when the physical body lives on based on their own selfish desires, it can become so vulnerable and weak. So let's try to pray at any and every given moment so that our spiritual self can overcome our physical self. _ . . #JubileeChallenge #BookOfMatthew #IChallengeYou #TrainStation #Abandoned #NewYork
