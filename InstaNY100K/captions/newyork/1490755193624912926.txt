An amazing woman! Victoria Woodhull, the first woman who ran for President in 1872, forty-eight years before women won the right to vote nation-wide. She ran on the newly formed Equal Rights Party platform, which supported the agenda of the emerging suffrage movement. An activist who supported women's suffrage and labor reforms, Woodhull believed that women should be able to marry and divorce without government interference. Her beliefs were ahead of the times, and even other suffragists thought her to be too radical (citation http://ow.ly/hhZ630aLIZB).
