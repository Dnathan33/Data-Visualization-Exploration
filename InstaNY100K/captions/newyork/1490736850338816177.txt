Commenting on the recent report in #TheGuardian that senior #WhiteHouse foreign policy official Sebastian Gorka has pushed for a plan to partition Libya into three areas, Libyan expert on regional issues Abu Bakr al Ansari suggested that the #West "has no idea what to do with the country after the murder of Muammar Gaddafi." The Guardian has recently revealed that senior White House foreign policy official, deputy assistant toÂ President #Trump Sebastian Gorka "has pushed a plan toÂ partition Libya, and once drew a picture ofÂ how the country could be divided intoÂ three areas onÂ a napkin inÂ a meeting withÂ a senior #European diplomat." "The map he drew onÂ a napkin duringÂ the transition period cut Libya intoÂ three sections, apparently based onÂ the old #Ottoman provinces ofÂ Cyrenaica inÂ the east, Tripolitania inÂ the north-west and Fezzan inÂ the south-west," the outlet elaborated.  Commenting onÂ the report, Libyan expert onÂ regional issues Abu Bakr al Ansari told Sputnik that it is aimed at "probing the possible reactions toÂ the suggestion withinÂ the country, inÂ the region and withinÂ the international community." "The West does not know what toÂ do withÂ Libya afterÂ the murder ofÂ Muammar Gaddafi. The neighboring countries are using the situation toÂ intimidate their own population byÂ threatening a repetition ofÂ the Libyan scenario. Meanwhile the Libyans are living underÂ the constant threat ofÂ interference inÂ their internal affairs & the instigation ofÂ various revolutions," he told Sputnik.  In case this plan comes intoÂ force, the expert said, it will lead toÂ a redrawing ofÂ the map acrossÂ many ofÂ the region's countries. "For example, Algeria and Chad could lay claims toÂ Fezzan region inÂ the south ofÂ Libya. However Tunisia, #Sudan & #Egypt will make challenges forÂ other areas ofÂ the country. Hence the partition ofÂ #Libya will bring a lot more problems thanÂ it could possibly solve. Besides, it won't satisfy either the Libyans or the populations ofÂ the neighboring countries asÂ it will bring the risk ofÂ a new calamity toÂ the region," he said.ğŸ‘‡ #Obama #HillaryClinton #NewYork #War
