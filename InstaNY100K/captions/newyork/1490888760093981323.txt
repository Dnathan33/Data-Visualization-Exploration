@Aphrochic's Bed-Stuy from the Brooklyn in Color Collection. From the streets that give the area itâ€™s name to the places, people and landmarks it defines, #BedStuy has long been an iconic #Brooklyn neighborhood. This colorful gray, with just a hint of lilac, is a beautiful complement to the kind of classic architecture that defines the interiors found in Bed-Stuy and all across the city. #collaboration #colorinspiration #NY #newyork #iloveNY #borough
