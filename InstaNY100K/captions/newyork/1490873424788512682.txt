Happiest Birthday to the partner of my dreams, @m_6ixtyone. I must have done something really REALLY great in a past life to get to wake up next to you every morning in this one. You make me so stupid happy my love (even when you are driving me fucking bonkers I'm still obsessed with you). Everything is more fun with you by my side. I can't wait to celebrate you tonight, for the rest of your "birthday month", and for the rest of our lives. I love you! ðŸŽ‚âœ¨ðŸ’ž
