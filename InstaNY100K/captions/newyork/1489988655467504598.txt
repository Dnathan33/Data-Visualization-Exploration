Ornella: "The story is about everything and nothing at the same time. It's about women, motherhood, relationships, and love â€“ and a little bit about men. I'm not sure yet if 'bad man' refers to a male person or to another human. I wanted to read something by a contemporary American artist. I'm a German multimedia artist and I admire that Miranda July does everything â€“ she's a filmmaker, performance artist, writer, she has made an app. She seems light and heavy at the same time and her work does too. My work plays with kitsch, like NASA imagery. It's pink and purple, and everything seems so dreamy and looks super romantic, but there's a long technological process behind it. Pictures of nebulas are taken via telescope and the light travels for such a long time that what we see might not exist anymore. I like that. It's all interpretation and we can only look so far." @studio_ornella_fieres reading #TheFirstBadMan by #MirandaJuly / @theubc for #subwaybookreview #newyork ðŸ—½
