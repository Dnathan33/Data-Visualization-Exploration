|| LOOK ME IN THE EYES || Love this bird, felt like he was scanning peoples souls, when they passed by... When I left the "Potting Shed" restaurant at @thegrounds we had very intense eyecontact, so I had to take this picture. Funny he didn't move at all, like a perfectly trained photo model. Well, maybe he didn't move, because he hasn't been sure, if I'm a good or a bad person 💁🏼🙊 . . . . . . . . #photography#animals#freelikeabird#pottingshed#thegroundsofalexandria#sydney#newyork#dinner#brunch#breakfast#nature#colour#delicious#foodphotography#beauty#lifestyle#travel#adventure#munich#happiness#igers#igersgermany
