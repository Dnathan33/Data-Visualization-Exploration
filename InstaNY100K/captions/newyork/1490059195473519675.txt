Your Old Droog – Artist Spotlight  The general consensus amongst the old school hip hop fans, especially the ‘stuck in the 90s’ rap fans, is that the skill level in rap has plummeted over the last 10 or so years and these new rappers are straight ‘trash’. With this particular set of lovely people in mind, I decided to use our Artist spotlight segment, to shine light on a promising newcomer, who stays very loyal to East-coast hip hop scene whilst adding his own spin on the sound. This rapper is Your Old Droog. Many may look at the name and be instantly turned off, due to its weirdness, but I am here to tell you, in terms of skill, he currently one of the best of the upcoming rappers in the scene.  Droog is Russian for friend, in case you were wondering, and when he first came out, many fans and critics alike, were convinced he was Nas and this was an alter-ego! This alone should give an insight into how skilled this young, Brooklyn rapper is and why hip hop fans should be checking him out. He has recently dropped new album, Packs, to critical acclaim and is an artist that is criminally overlooked.  @yourolddroog  #song #album #hiphop #yourolddroog #newyork #rap #music #blog #magazine #nutty #bars
