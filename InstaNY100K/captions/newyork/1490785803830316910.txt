#LeMosenxRadical #DawnbyLeMosen A Creative Collaboration. â€¢ At Dawn she feel freedom.  In the emptiness of the streets.  In the closed doors and locked stores.  In the silence that whips through the alleys of Downtown.  At Dawn she is a bird.  She can land and sit still.  She can fly, swoop and dance in the heart of the city.  Like no one is watching.  Because no one is watching.  And when they awaken, she will be gone. @lemosen @kamila_bakhtiyar
