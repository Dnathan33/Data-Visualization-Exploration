I don't have siblings being an only child, but I found a sister in my friend @laurencsglazer 👩🏼‍⚖️👩🏻‍⚖️ We became friends at @sothebysinstitute before school even started in the summer of 2015 because we were the only people that did the entire summer reading list and we would email/text each other asking what the other thought and asking about each other's progress (there was a lot of books). Once in New York we discovered we have the same birthday, April 26, except I was born in 1992 and her 1993. We bonded over our dedication to work hard and always give 200%, our love of art, Instagram, and sweets 🍪This photo was taken by my mentor and one of our favorite professors @kathybattista at our graduation. I look like a goofball but happy #nationalsiblingday Lauren! #birthday #taurus #birthdaysisters #graduation #siaalumni #sothebys #sothebysinstituteofart #sothebysauctionhouse #masterofarts #newyorkcity #birthdaysister #newyorkcity #newyork
