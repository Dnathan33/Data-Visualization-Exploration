Finally done with this floor, felt like it took forever but was well worth it. I love how every tile is a different pattern. The design on this porcelain tile is amazing. Installed over a mud bed and used RLS Leveling system. Best of all, when it's cold outside...Just warm up the floor with #nuheat.  #DalTile #Tile #porcelain #kitchen #construction #tileinstallation #donetile #newyork #Charlotte #imagica #cosmo #LFT #time #perfection #design #trade #craft #renovation #lipfree #raimondi
