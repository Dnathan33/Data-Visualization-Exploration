Foggy and rainy night in NYC.  Probably one of the last, if not the last photo I will be taking from this perch, looking down at the view below.  While I'm not going anywhere, I will miss looking down and seeing the New York Public Library and all of Bryant Park... and looking straight out the window to see the Chrysler Building.. Goodnight, #NewYork! #bryantpark #newyorkpubliclibrary #mynewyork #myny #mynyc #manhattan #midtown #midtownmanhattan #lookingdown #chrysler_building #willmissthis
