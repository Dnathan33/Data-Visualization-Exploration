SS Conte Verde portrayed in Shangai in Lloyd Triestino's pattern. The ship had been launched at William Beardmore & Co. of Dalmuir (Glasgow) in 1922 for Lloyd Sabaudo. From 1923 to 1932 she sailed on North and South America routes with her sister SS Conte Rosso. In 1932, after the union of the main italian shipping companies (Cosulich line, Lloyd Sabaudo and N.G.I.) in Italian Line, she and her sister were sold to Lloyd Triestino for luxuriuos Trieste - Shangai route. She received a great restyling in 1933 and carried mainly first class passengers and goods on East Asia route. Sometimes she was also used as cruise ship in the Mediterranian sea. In June 1940 she was internatened in Shangai (Japanese dominion at the time) and used for exchanges of American and Japanese prisoners. After Italian armistice of 1943, her crew received the order of sink her, so she was sunk by her own crew in 1944.
