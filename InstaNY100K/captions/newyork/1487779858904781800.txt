The Nassau County Civil Service Commission agreed to recheck the candidate’s blood pressure and found it to be within the MPTC standards. Candidate’s disqualification was overturned in October 2013. #sheerinlaw #disqualification #nassau #suffolk #county #nyc #newyork #newyorkcity #bestofthebest #police #fire #department #departmentofsanitationnyc
