💙🦄🌈 I couldn't possible know every single Mat&Kitchen.com member but I certainly feel like our souls connect on some energetic level and I'd certainly like to attempt to meet/connect with  every single member at least once online, via email or in person.  Today was one of those moments to connect to someone who has been #onthemat with me for over 2 1/2 years and we've NEVER chatted online (that is truly rare for members). Tonight she made her way to my free class in #DUMBO......didn't let anything stop her (including mercury in retrograde or forgotten pants). There's nothing we can't handle in order to have a good laugh, a potential life lesson or a chance of a lifetime. Marie rsvp'd for my Tuesday class and shared a bit of her journey that I'm beyond grateful to be a part of 🙌🏻👊🏼🙏🏻 #autoimmune issues are NOT a death sentence. They do NOT mean you can't ever workout again. They do NOT mean you can't be well. You can thrive. You can heal. You just need the right info, tools and perhaps teacher. There is a way to navigate your #AI issues #onthemat for not only survival but healing and thrival. THANK YOU Marie Picard for coming out to share, connect, hug and show off your impeccable form, technique, alignment and indomitable spirit. I got you sista 👊🏼 #sista #thrival
