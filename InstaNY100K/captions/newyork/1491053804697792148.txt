Starting over in a new place and making new friends is difficult for a lot of people, but it's especially difficult with someone who struggles with codependency. - Creating new relationships is not easy when you're still healing from past trauma. - What's helped me is focusing on things that I like to do and meeting people organically through those channels. - I never considered myself very social, but I think that's a limiting belief I set on myself because of a deep fear I had  of not being liked or accepted. - To break this cycle of "unsocialness" I joined a running club at work. Running is something I like and was already doing on my own, so it was an easy and less intimating way to start making better connections and friends in my life - - - #newfriends #newyork #running #selfcare #sociallyawkward #awkward #limitingbeliefs #run #girlswhorun #codependent #relationships
