When you are so overwhelmed with happiness that your eyes make half moons!! Aaron and I are celebrating our third year of marriage and I am so blessed to have him in my life to be my support and my rock. So happy he was able to come to my yoga graduation! ✌🏽❤️😁 #heaven #newyork #newyorkcity #honeymoonhayters #nyc #ny #yoga #graduation #namaste #laughinglotus #love #angelintraining #beanangel #happy #halfmoon #love #hustle
