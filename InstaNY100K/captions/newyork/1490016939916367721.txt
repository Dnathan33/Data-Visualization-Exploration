Update on Maxy! Maxy was bathed, groomed, and is feeling MUCH better.. just a little tender loving care goes a long way.  We will know today after a full examination and diagnostic tests by our vet partner if Maxy has any long standing medical issues. His back legs appear weak which might need some strengthening.  We will keep you posted as to Maxy's medical status. He is approx 3 years old and 10 lbs, and he will need a home to go to when he arrives in NY!! Will you help?
