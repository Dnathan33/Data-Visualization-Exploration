Confession of a Karachi Kid (1/2)  For someone outside Karachi, it's the perfect place for an adventurous life. It's the New York of Pakistan, what with it's daily hustle bustle, late nights, parties and lights. Born and living in Karachi, I know the reality. Sure, life in Karachi is never boring, wonder why? It's because the constant fear of being kidnapped, or killed, keeps the adrenaline rushing through your veins. The constant fights between drivers and pedestrians gives you enough drama to last a week. Not to forget, that despite being a supposedly 'City of Lights', fanning yourself in the darkness is every Karachitte's past time.
