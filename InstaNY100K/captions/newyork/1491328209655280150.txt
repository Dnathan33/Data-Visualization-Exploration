ALLACCESS MOODBOARD BY STEFANO BASSO/BASSO ARCHIVE (@aquaswindle) - PATTI SMITH, NEW YORK, 1976 PHOTO @godlis Taken in the Bowery, New York City, outside CBGB. I find Patti Smith splendid, in this picture. When I read something written by her or I think about her in an abstract way, my mind goes immediately to this photo. Often her photos picture her posing, this one has captured her in a natural expression, amazed and fragile, that makes her beautiful to my eyes. I have recently bought a T-shirt with this picture on it at a concert and I wear it as an exquisite garment. - - #allaccessproject #allaccessmoodboard #musicphotograph #bassoarchive #davidgodlis #pattismith #newyork #godlis #cbgb
