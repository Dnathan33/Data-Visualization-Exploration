1) Checked my email upon waking (which i normally dont do) and found a nice work surprise, 2) checked my morning temp and panicked at the drop to 96.1, 3) missed the daily Â¥500 set at Sukiya/Matsuya, 4) @nickebnerfitness told me i was undereating....pretty much calls for TAMAGO KAKE GOHAN, SAKE, SHIRO MISO, NATTOU. Day's pretty much accomplished at this point. #gastro #theErrantDiner #newyork
