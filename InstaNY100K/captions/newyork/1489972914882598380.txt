Meet Ludlow, a 7 month old Doberman/Plott Hound mix who just wants a loving forever family. Ludlow is 37lbs, neutered, and UTD on shots.  His foster family says: "Ludlow is such an amazing kind hearted dog who wants to be loved and is so happy snuggling next to his people and fur sibling! He is house trained, knows his basic commands, not food or toy aggressive, and dog friendly. He gets along wonderfully with his foster brother. They love to wrestle and chase each other around the yard. He is also very polite meeting other dogs on walks. He would do best in a home with a yard and another confident playful dog(s)." Ludlow sadly didn't get the proper socialization as a young pup so things unknown to him frighten him. His foster family is working to improve his socialization by getting him out in new environments, and around different people. They are seeing progress everyday but he will need his forever family to continue to get his confidence up!
