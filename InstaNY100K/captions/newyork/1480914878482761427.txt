No longer you have to sacrifice your delicate skin!  We put makeup which ofcourse contain chemicals. So for removing the makeup why again we have to use chemicals?? Does it make sense? And plus the makeup removers are so expensive. Why do we pay so much for chemicals which Ultimately makes our skin bad or worse.  Absolutely not! We can still make a nice make up remover with not so expensive products and still have a glowing & healthy skin. ‚ù§  So I have switched to this simple and effective and chemical free make up remover! And Tadaaa.. The only 2 ingredients are Baby Oil &  H2O (Water) üòä  So this The Body Shop's Shower Gel bottle I have reused for storing this make up remover.  How I made it, Filled the bottle half with Baby Oil & Half with water. That's it. Just shake well before use and it works wonders. Just like a high end makeup remover!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ I am thoroughly enjoying this. Do try & let me know how it works for you.
