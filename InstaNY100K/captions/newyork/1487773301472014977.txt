Since starting my crochet journey I always go back to a jellyfish pattern I purchased way back when. And to this day, it still confuses the hell out of me. So with a lots of patience and pretty yarn, I created my own! They're not perfect but I'm totally in love 🐚🐚 . . . #handmade #crochet #jellyfish #homedecor #wallart #yarn #crochetersofinstagram #aqua #teal #cotton #summer #beachstyle #beachdecor #etsy #etsyseller #etsysellersofinstagram #etsyshop #shopetsy #shophandmade #shopsmallbusiness #longisland #newyork
