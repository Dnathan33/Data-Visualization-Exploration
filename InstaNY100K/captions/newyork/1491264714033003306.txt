Went to Bash Bish yesterday afternoon. Sent the drone up it was the first time doing so at a very busy state park. Got a little more attention then I would have liked but it was worth it for the video and photos I got. this park is on the New York and Mass border you can get to the falls from either side. #dronepointofview #dronepic #dronephotography #dronepicture #dronestagram #bashbishfalls #bashbish #massachusetts #newyork #stateparks #statepark #yuneectyphoonh #yuneec #waterfall #waterfallphotography
