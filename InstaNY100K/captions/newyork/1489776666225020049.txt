Mishu was found stray when he was around 2 months old with his other 3 siblings when we were posted in Geneva, 🇨🇭. He has since then followed us to New York and now in Jakarta. What a long journey for a cat. He is going to be 8 years old in September. He is such a friendly cat and a fighter..we love him very much ❤️🐾🐈ps. He has a swiss passport 😻#mishu #genevacat #geneve🇨🇭 #mondayinjakarta #catmonday #catofinstagram #straycats #adoptdontshop #catfighter #travelingcat #catlover #catloversclub #newyorker #newyork #borningeneva
