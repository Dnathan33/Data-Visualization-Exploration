For you, my heart's lid has been held ajar.  But unfortunately, I can only admire you from afar.  My passion for you burns like a furnace; my soul comes to char.  I love you so much it has left a flesh wound; a scar that I'll see daily until my dead ashes are put in a jar.  Beautiful woman, you're the calm at dusk. A morning star.
