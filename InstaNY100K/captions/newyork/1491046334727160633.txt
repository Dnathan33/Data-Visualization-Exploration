Today, on National Library Workers Day,Â I ask you to join me in showing appreciation for these tireless staff members and the unique services that they provide ALL New Yorkers.  The Mayor and City Council are currently deciding how much funding to allocate to libraries next year. This funding is critical, and could keep library doors open for longer hours and on more days.  Please take 30 seconds to send a message to City leaders, telling them how important libraries are to ALL New Yorkers.
