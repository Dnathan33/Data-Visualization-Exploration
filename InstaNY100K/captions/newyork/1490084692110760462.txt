Glenmorangie #Signet Single Malt Scotch Whisky is a marriage of #whisky produced from two unique types of malted barley: Cadboll malted barley and malted chocolate barley (often used to create craft beers). The whisky produced from Cadboll malted barley, which is harvested on the rolling hills that surround #Glenmorangie Distillery, contributes a creamy, vanilla flavor to #GlenmorangieSignet. The chocolate barley, however, is "the heart of the recipe," says Lumsden. The high roasted chocolate malt "is tumble roasted in the same way coffee beans would be,"and as a result, contributes strong notes mocha, cacao beans and milk chocolate to the whisky.  #whiskygents #gentlemen#vancouver #london #california #scotland#toronto #newyork #scotch #singlemalt#scotchwhisky #kentucky #bourbon#whisky #whiskey
