The first thing I thought when I saw this piece was, "Dang this looks like Donald Judd piece." And guess what? It was inspired by Judd! This work is in the really interesting and reading-heavy exhibit "The ARCADES: Contemporary Art and Walter Benjamin". The entire exhibit is a culmination of the final work by the Jewish philosopher Walter Benjamin who wrote "The Arcades Project" which basically predicted how we experience modernity today. Each work shown is by different artists and paired with a "Convolute", Benjamin's name given to each part of the "The Arcades Project". Each "convolute" is also paired with a poem inspired by it by Kenneth Goldsmith. This convolute is: "V Conspiracies, Compagnonnage" and the work "What You See Is What It Is" is by #voluspajarpa 2013. #walterbenjamin #philosophy #philosopher #theory #donaldjudd #jewishmuseum #thejewishmuseum #thearcades #thearcadesproject #newyorkcity #newyorkart #newyork
