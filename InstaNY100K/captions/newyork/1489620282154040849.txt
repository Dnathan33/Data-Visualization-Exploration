Positively enjoying life since I finished my thesis because I get to see more films! Finally get to watch our Sara Driver boxset 👠💁🏻📽✨I am loving New York in the 80s on screen! Is there a city like New York in the 80s with abandoned warehouses and exciting underground scenes in existence today because I would like to go to there 🙃🙃🙃 #sleepwalk #saradriver #newyork #fantasy #womeninfilm #femaledirectors
