My Top 10 of All Time : Taxi Driver - Martin Scorsese makes the list, yet again. Travis Bickle is a Vietnam vet, returning to NYC and accepting a job as a Taxi driver. As he navigates through the city, his indignation with the city's crime and apathy erodes his morale, which makes him feel inclined to do something about it. Taxi Driver is still my absolute favorite Scorsese film, for many reasons. This is one of the few films that I've seen over 50 times (no shit) & I still find something new to love about it. This film is the ultimate indictment of loneliness. As  psychologically damaged Travis is, the audience still finds empathy with him. That's due to De Niro's outstanding performance. The pacing, throughout the entire film, is glacial but that's why it's so important. Every scene sees Travis slowly erode and tension builds to volcanic levels. You're dreading what he's capable of, as well as feel so bad for the guy. When he tries to connect with others, his ineptitude and awkwardness thwarts it horribly. I could examine the character all day, thanks to Paul Schrader's fantastic script. Scorsese's direction is classy and confident. He manages to encompass what made 70's films so powerful, while retaining the nuance of classic noir films. Taxi Driver continues to impress and enlighten me. I love showing it to people. I especially love Bernard Herrmann's beautiful soundtrack as well. #filmfrequencies #film #filmlife #filmbuff #filmmaker #filmlover #filmisnotdead #movie #movies #movietime #movielover #movienight #cine #cinema #cinephile #martinscorsese #taxidriver #robertdeniro #70s #dÄ±rector #nyc #newyork #masterpiece #alltimefavorite #top10
