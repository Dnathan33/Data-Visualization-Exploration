#Throwback to the FAILE & BÄST Deluxx Fluxx Arcade #exhibit at the @brooklynmuseum⠀ ⠀ The #arcade was an #interactive environment that included #videogames #pinball machines, and #foosball tables that are simultaneously #sculptures and functioning #games . The #installation is a nostalgic nod to #videoarcades and #punkrock and #grafitti #culture .⠀ ⠀ #faileart raises questions about our relationship to consumer culture, religious traditions, and the urban environment by blurring the boundaries between #fineart , #streetart, and #popculture⠀ .⠀ .⠀ #faile #colorpop #newyork #nycartist #nycart #nyc #creative #neon #colors #brooklynmuseum
