I am in New York City. I. AM. IN. NEW. YORK. CITY. I am so excited I still can't believe it. This morning I've been to this amazing book shop called Book Culture. I swear it's like paradise, a bookstagrammer's paradise lol. I haven't bought anything so far, but I surely will. I'll probably buy one of this Blind Date With A Book!:)üòç -nina
