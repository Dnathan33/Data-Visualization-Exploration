No Lie, Meeting @wizkhalifa Last Year Was The Best Memory of 2016 For Me (For Personal Reasons), But To Bump Into His Mom During Breakfast While We're In New York Was Amazing. The Advice & Motivation She Gave Us Only Added More Fuel To Our Fire To Keep Going Hard. Thank You Mrs. @ogjuspeachie For Being Such A Blessing To Us. It Was An Honor Meeting You & A Memory I Will Hold For A Lifetime. As We Keep Grinding To Reach Success, We Pray Much More Success Over You & Your Family. See You At The Top & When We Win Our First Grammy, You & Wiz Are At The Top of Our Thank You List lol God Bless!! #Wow #Blessed #Motivation #Thankful #Humble #NewYork #WizKhalifa #Mom #TaylorGang #GodIsGreat #Grinding #Artist #Rapper #Music #HipHop #1 #Pittsburgh #West #Virginia #Ohio #YNC
