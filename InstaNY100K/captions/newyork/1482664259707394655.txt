Taken March 31st, 2010! The day I moved from SF to NYC! 7 Years Baby! Woo! Love this city! ‚ù§Even through all the hardships of moving around this city, coming here by myself, not really knowing anyone (except for @olgakarmansky who so incredibly generously let me stay with her for a month and wouldn't take my money. Thank you so much! Also grateful to all the people I met who were little angels along the way, when I thought I had nothing. Thank you. Grateful to live in a city that has everything; my heart is in the arts, dance, theatre, art, etc, I wouldn't live anywhere else right now. #newyorkaversary #flashback #lovemycity #grateful #happygal #memories #badass #newyorkstories #newyork #lovewhereyoulive
