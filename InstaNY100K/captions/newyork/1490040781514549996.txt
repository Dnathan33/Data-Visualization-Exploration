If you see through the smoke , you'll see there is so much hope , so much room for the youth to grow, this isn't the same New York we used to know, young adults using dope , the politicians on the podium telling amusing jokes while we just view from home , Pepsi trying to stop wars while gangs start more over coke.......#candoscandid #livingcolor #poems #words #truth #nyc #hope #dailyart #newyork #truth
