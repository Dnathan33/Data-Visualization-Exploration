I used to work as a foster care caseworker. An average day might mean I went to a school, day care, foster home, prison visit or court. I always had kids in my car. So much YUCK! I found out about Thieves. I started diffusing in my office for a few hours a day. I was healthy ALL winter! When everyone else was out of work, I was happy and healthy diffusing in  my office. Now that I am a SAHM, we diffuse at home. My almost 2 yr old doesn't know what it is like to feel yucky. Thieves is a mom's best secret to wellness.
