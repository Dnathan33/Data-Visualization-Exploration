SHORT HAIR DON'T CARE PT.2 • #WillSmith is happy to help son #JadenSmith get ready for a new project in any way he can even if it means #cutting off all his #hair! The #SuicideSquad star took to #Facebook on #Tuesday to share a few photos from the dramatic #haircut, which show #TheFreshPrince excitedly holding up the massive bundle of blonde #dreads he'd just cut off. • @c.syresmith  #msftsrep #fallen #movie #film #music #blacksnobiety
