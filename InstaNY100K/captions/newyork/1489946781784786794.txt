CAUTION: PISO MOJADO In this abandoned place only lit by single beam of a light we find ourselves surrounded by the inviting dark. I've been to this place before in the day, but it never felt creepy, things change. It felt creepy this night, not scary... but you knew that it had the potential to become scary at any moment. That is the difference between creepy & scary. 1 reason was because it had recently become slightly flooded and ironically there was a piso mojado sign in the middle of the floor, as if some conscientious ghost cared about safety first. There was a loud but distant dripping sound. Water. A running sound of water with a source never identified The whole time I wondered where was it coming from? Far?  It sounded like footsteps.  That flat, echoing thud of oxfords or some official shoe on damp concrete.  At one point we saw a bright light behind the curtain and a violent, slamming noise,  we looked at each other...eyebrows crunching together in confusion! We all knew what we were thinking "Where was the light coming from?" "Why did it flash so fast?" "I was personally thinking it was a strange color...and we all were thinking..."Was there a window back there behind the stage"? I didn't see one. Did you? We turned all of our equipment off, standing still in the cold darkness, camouflaged behind only the footstep sounds of the water and complete blackness & leaks. Nah,  no one was coming in here in the complete Darkness... you'd need a light. The light we saw was just a leftover flame from us, but it was too wet internally,  to do anything but extinguish. We exhaled & the light came back on.... #bigbootyescapades  Join me @nyc_explorers #nyc_explorers ðŸ”¦ðŸ”¦ðŸ”¦ðŸ”¦ðŸ”¦ðŸ”¦ðŸ”¦ðŸ”¦ðŸ”¦#cuiado In frame:  @bklynborn81 @eric.harrington28  #moodygrams #nycprimeshot #bando #urbandecay #weekly_feature #newyork #neverstopexploring #macmiller #weekly_feature #nbc4ny #nytimes #newyork #neverstopexploring #bestoftheday #getupny #thecreatorclass #meistergrams #depthobsessed #launchdsigns #cdetailsfeature #dopeclickz #fatalframes #what_i_saw_in_nyc #opticinstincts #wandertones #gram #silhouette
