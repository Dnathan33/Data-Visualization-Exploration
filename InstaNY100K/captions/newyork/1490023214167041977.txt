April 10 Flora - archive from August 2016 - near Rochester, NY. "Flora - plant life occurring in a particular region - native plant life." Sunflowers, also known by their scientific name Helianthus, thrive in all 50 states in the US as well as Canada, Mexico, Central America, Europe as well as Russia. (I've seen pictures of sunflowers from other areas of the world as well!)
