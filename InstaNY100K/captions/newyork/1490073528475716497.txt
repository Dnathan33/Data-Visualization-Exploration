"As an actor you can never take anything personally. You may be talented and attractive and still not get the job. They might just be looking for something else. Dont get discouraged. Don't give up. Keep trying. Keep moving forward." #lifeofanactor  #actor #athlete #movie #tv #hustle #grind #repeat #lifeofanactor #neverquit #LA #hollywood #art #entertainment #actors #artist #movies #fashion #talent #drama #act #theater #NewYork #life #cinema #tattoos #filmmaking #actorslife #villain
