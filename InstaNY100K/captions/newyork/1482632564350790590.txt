Got to shout out one of my favorite softball players in the world my girl Carma celebrating her birthday right after mines about a little over a week ago. She was out with her Florida State University softball friends starting with the coaches last week at the UVA vs Florida State Softball Games 2017! ☝🏽⚾️
