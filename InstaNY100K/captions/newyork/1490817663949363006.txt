I've been thinking about my grandma so much lately; the extraordinary owner of this ring. She had this incomparable appreciation for the beauty of the world around her. Seeing a bright blue sky or emerald forest in the distance would nearly bring her to tears. She never lost that childlike wonder when it came to looking at nature's magic. I'm trying to see the world through her beautiful eyes. ðŸŒºðŸŒŽ
