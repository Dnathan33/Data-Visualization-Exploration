As a naturalized American citizen, forced to flee Iran as a young girl, and a grateful refugee who found support in Germany, then the U.S.; I am also often in Canada, where beloved members of my family live. While I am deeply troubled and saddened by the way refugees are being politicized and too often demeaned, with an increasing number of attempted travel bans driven by religious bias, I was thrilled to read the announcement a few days ago that the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be welcoming the courageous and inspiring Malala Yousafzai to Canada later this week, making her an honorary Canadian citizen. “Ms. Yousafzai’s courageous response to those who threatened her life, and her advocacy for girls’ education, has inspired many millions of people around the world,” Trudeau said in a press release. “Her story is one of determination and dignity, and Canada is proud to call her an honorary citizen of this great country.” The 19-year-old Yousafzai will also become the youngest person to address Canada’s parliament and just the sixth honorary Canadian citizen of all time given this great honor. Other great leaders, including #NelsonMandela and the #DalaiLama, have graced Canada by joining in their ranks. Canada is a beautiful country, with a longstanding tradition of welcoming all, regardless of race, religion, and nationality, and with Prime Minister Trudeau at the helm, this tradition continues.
