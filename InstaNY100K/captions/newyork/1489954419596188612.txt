063/365 Q-Tip - The Renaissance (2008) "In the land of make believe, time to make unbelief believable/ Taking belief to the realm of real/ Believing this shit that's force fed through the media/ Believing it's real when it's really a raw deal/ Never disbelieve when you see a human miracle/ Like ghetto children shining bright in Babylon" #365albums #mabsoares_albums #phonic_teachings #qtip #theabstract #abstractpoetic #kamaalfareed #therenaissance #atcq #atribecalledquest #nativetongues #theummah #stalbans #queens #nyc #newyork #newyorkcity #hiphop
