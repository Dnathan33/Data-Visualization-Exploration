Even though I do not support Lionel Messi's football club, I acknowledge his great talent and the power of his words in this quote. We often throw in the towel or tapout from commitments way too soon! We give up on our fitness goals, healthy eating habits, love life, and financial goals even before they start sprouting. But I have noticed through out history that EVERY successful person, in ALL aspects of life, make this same statement in their own words. Are they are all clearly telling us that NEVER GIVING UP is a key attitude to success? I think so! And they are absolutely right because no one ever achieved anything but failure by consistently giving up. Stay focused on your goals as you enjoy this beautiful day!!#peace 🙏 🌞🌝 #ewillie 🔥 🔥 🔥 🔥  #tuesday #goodmorning #inspiration #newyork #motivation #dedication #meditation #play #life #tea #lifestyle #yoga #calm #joy #success #fight #happy  #music  #fitness #food #poetry #work #love #vegan #workout #vegetarian #instagram #instamood
