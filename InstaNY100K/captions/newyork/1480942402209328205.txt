Day 365 - Lou Gehrig, Baseball Player "Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth." - Lou Gehrig (1903-1941) Henry Louis "Lou" or "Buster" Gehrig was an American baseball first baseman who played 17 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, from 1923 through 1939. Gehrig was renowned for his prowess as a hitter and for his durability, a trait that earned him his nickname "The Iron Horse". He was an All-Star seven consecutive times, a Triple Crown winner once, an American League (AL) Most Valuable Player twice, and a member of six World Series champion teams. He had a career .340 batting average, .632 slugging average, and a .447 on base average. He hit 493 home runs and had 1,995 runs batted in (RBI). In 1939, he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame and was the first MLB player to have his uniform number (4) retired by a team. #cemetery #cemetery_shots #graveyard #graveyard_dead #graveyard_life #aj_graveyards #tv_churchandgraves #findagrave #taphophile #gravestones  #sixfeetunder #graveyard_shots #history #baseball #newyorkcity #newyork #mlb #newyorkyankees #yankees #lougehrig #lougehrigdisese #als #baberuth #halloffame #ftgmyfavorites  Popularity:⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ Difficulty:⭐️⭐️ Fun Fact: In 1927, teammates Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth (#ftgruth) out-homered every team in baseball except one. That year Ruth hit 60 homers and Gehrig hit 47, more than anyone other than Ruth had ever hit. Together they out-homered every team in baseball except one. To put this achievement into perspective, the top two homerun hitters in 2011 hit a combined total of 84 homeruns, a level every Major League Baseball team surpassed. Also, Lou Gehrig was the first athlete to have his number retired. Upon his retirement from baseball in 1939, the New York Yankees retired his No. 4 jersey. This was the first time a professional sports team retired a jersey. Today, the practice of retiring jerseys numbers is carried out in most sports.  Source: Wikipedia.
