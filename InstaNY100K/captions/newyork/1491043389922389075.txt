PUT IT IN THE BOOKS!  The Mets offense explodes with 14 runs on 20 hits, as they take game 2 over the Phillies by the score of 14-4. Yoenis Cespedes had himself a near historic night, going deep 3 times within the first 5 innings and finishing 3-for-6 with 5 RBI's. A fourth home run would've put Cespedes in an exclusive group of players to have done that. Lucas Duda went yard twice, Travis d'Arnaud and Asdrubal Cabrera also each homered. That's a team total of 7 on the night. Matt Harvey earned his second win of the season after allowing 2 runs on 5 hits through 5 2/3 innings. Harvey however left the game in the 6th with was later said to be a tight left hamstring, hopefully it's not too serious. The Mets now lead the series 2 games to 0 and will look to finish off the sweep tomorrow night.
