Had such a great first day in NYC! In the city by 7.30am (jet lag is a bitch!), and spent the day exploring the parks, viewing the architecture, using the subway, crying over alchocol prices and eating everything in sight; Pretzels in Central Park, Pizza in Little Italy and a midnight Burger just off of Times Square 👌🌍🌎🌏 Last day in NY today before catching a bus to Boston this evening. #nyc #newyork #jetlag #earlystart #travelling #sightseeing #tourists #centralpark #bryantpark #architecture #empirestatebuilding #grandcentral #pretzels #pizza #littleitaly #chinatown #burger #midnightsnack #5napkinburger #sogood #timessquare #boston #massachusetts #exciting #couple #coupleswhotravel
