October 16: Save the Date, New Yorkers!  For every soldier the USA has lost in combat, 25-30 take their own lives. This is an incredible statistic. @getheadstrong helps veterans in amazing ways but it costs an average of $5,000 to treat one veteran. If you can, get involved and help them to raise funds to continue their incredible work 🇺🇸 ✌🏻 💳 #nyc #headstrong #getheadstrong #ptsd #ptsdawareness #military #USmilitary #servicemen #servicewomen #fundraising #charity #army #marines #armedforces #armyvet #armyveterans #navy #gala #charitygala #newyork #mentalhealth #veteransupport #chelseapiers
