Accomplishment. I ran 21.20 miles yesterday and biked 35.11 miles today. This is the most mileage I have ever done in my life and it all started inspiringly with a small revelation on a trip less than a year ago! This huge accomplishment gives meaning to those little victories too. Running 1 mile farther, running 1 mile faster, running 1 mile without pain.  And... "I FEEL GREAT!" (in the words of Casey Neistat)
