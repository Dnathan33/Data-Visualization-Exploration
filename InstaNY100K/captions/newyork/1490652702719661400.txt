I think it's common for us to fall in love and forget ourselves. I'm going to use myself as an example. I've fallen in love full heartedly, when I was half of me and thought the other piece was the person i was in love with. But the lesson being learned is I need to love myself completely. Then I will find the one who compliments and not completes me.  #Undiscovered_muas  #makeupfanatic1  #wewearwhatwewant #fromwhereistand #ootd #ootdchannel #springcolors #plussizefashionforwomen #teamsuper #plussize  #fashionblogger #africanskillingit #fashionblogger #beautyblogger #styleblogger #stylist #streetstyle #stylegram #fblogger #springbreak2017 #fashiongram #fashionphotography #fashion #newyork #rockafellercenter #manhattan #streetstyle  #sprinflowers #nikon  #instyle #fullfigured #kyliecosmetics
