Walked the Brooklyn Bridge today and it was absolutely one of my fave experiences so far ‚ù§ We only stayed in Brooklyn a few hours but I am a BIG fan. There was gorgeous views, flea markets and this great photo opportunity for the typical tourist that I am. Also I had my second ShakeShack of the holiday and I ain't even sorry üòè . . . #dumbobrooklyn #brooklynbridge #brooklyn #lowermanhattan #downtown #welcometonewyork #thebigapple #newyork #travel #usa #travelphotography #travelblog #america #blog #blogger #lifestyle #lblogger #instagood #newyorkcity #manhattan #tourist #nycvibes #newyorknewyork #manhattanbridge
