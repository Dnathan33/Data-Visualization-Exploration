Lights out at for #EarthHour at #UnitedNations Headquarters in #NYC on Saturday night. How did you spend Earth Hour? â € Around the globe, millions of people, businesses, and landmarks set aside an hour to host events, switch off their lights, and make noise for climate action. â € Climate change is real and it's happening now. But by taking urgent climate action we will create jobs, improve our health and save money. "Climate change is undeniable. Climate action is unstoppable," Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said this week. ðŸ“·: @somikabasu .#GlobalGoals #ParisAgreement #globalgoals #newyork #climateaction #climatechange #climatechangeisreal #unachicago
