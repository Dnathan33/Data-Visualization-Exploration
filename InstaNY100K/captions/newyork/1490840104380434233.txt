Beautiful view from New York City 🇺🇸 Thanks to @mohammed_19_91 👏👏👏 #Repost @mohammed_19_91 with @repostapp ・・・ The impact of the Great War on the United States saw political, economic and social changes. The United States emerged from the war as a world military and industrial leader.  Unlike the war-torn cities of Europe the homes and industries of the nation were relatively unscathed by the Great War. The late entry of the US meant that fewer men had lost their lives than in Europe.  Production and efficiency in industries and factories had increased. Technology had advanced and the nation had entered the age of steel and electricity. #newyork #newyorkcity #nyc #usa #america #statueofliberty #summer #beautiful #beauty #love #history #adventure #explore #adventure #sea #unitedstates #sunnyday #view #instagood #instadaily #instalike #instatravel #wanderlust #picoftheday #pictureoftheday #travel #travelgram #traveltheworld #travelphotography #traveller_stories
