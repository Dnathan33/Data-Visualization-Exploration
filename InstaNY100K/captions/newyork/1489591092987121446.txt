Preparing for a long hike at the start of this spring break. With having time off I can finally get back into the wild. This hike was planned in my head for a while, as it was actually my Sambo Coach, Stephen Koepfer who told me about it...its located in the Catskills,  about a 10 mile hike, that covers the tallest mountain in the region (being Slide mountain) however, we will also be hiking over Wittenburg and Cornell mountains which are all in the region aswell. 1 day. 3 peaks. 10 miles. Challenge accepted. Now a little about the packing. I have been trying to pack with more efficiency and lighter each hike. Here we just have the basics, compass and medical kit on the inside, first thing to reach for if lost or hurt. Spork, headlamp (with batteries), and a few snacks on the outer compartment right behind my head for easy access. Inside, we have my jacket tucked away in a compression bag on the bottom. Food in the middle (also the heaviest, as I ran out of dry meals, and had to settle for canned goods, going old school) and socks with gloves on one side with spare clothes on the other, so the food cans dont wobble around as I hike. Now all thats left is water, and ofc my trusty Recon Scout (survival knife) on the front bag strap for easy access. Cant wait! Coach did it in 2001. We're gonna do it 16 years later!  ____________________________ #adventure #hiking #mountaineering #hikingadventure #snow #mountains #slidemountain #newyork #newyorkstate #winterhike #snowycondtions #woods #trekking #climbing #training #fitness #friendship #outdoors #photography #explore #wild #lost #endurance #perseverance #conquer #thewild #athlete #landscape #wanderlust #wittenburgmountain
