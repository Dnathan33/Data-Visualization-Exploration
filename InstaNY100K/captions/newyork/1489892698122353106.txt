After a long, tiring eight hours fly, I arrived at New York yesterday. The view was beautiful from the plain. I settled down and went for a quick shopping: 'Let's see what I can do!' I'll be honest! It wasn't easy to buy anything to make a tasty recipe. I've got limited chance to find a shop near me and stay on budget and stick to my principles. So finelly I bought some peppers,  tomatoes, kale, spinach, apple and pineapple for a salad and a morning smoothie.  Yeeee 80% organic. ---------‚ù§--------‚ù§---------‚ù§---------- Now I'm ready to discover the city. üòÑ  #newyork #smoothie #smoothiebowl #juicebar #adventuretime #organic #travellife #healthyhappylife #discover #salad #ilovemylife‚ù§Ô∏è #feelings #holiday #happyholidays #ilovefood
