Celebrating and thanking my sister on #nationalsiblingsday. She has been on a mission - dumpster diving no less! - collecting #umbrellasofnewyork (and who knew that hashtag already existed ⁉️) for #weathervainjewelry. God, I love her!! 👸🏼☂️🗽🗑👍🏼❤ These will be thoroughly cleaned and transformed into jewelry near you! #newyork #asheville #skrapmonkey #yeahthatgreenville #mysistersorocks
