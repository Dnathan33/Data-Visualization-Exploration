I decided to walk along my street, W70th, to Central Park this morning. Waking past beautiful brownstones, I saw 2 books on the sidewalk next to someone's garbage bags.  I looked around, guessed they were for me, and sat on their steps and read them.  The first, this one, contains a whole bunch of messages that seemed written for me, right now. "Sometimes the way to do what you hope to do will be clear cut, and sometimes it will be almost impossible to decide whether or not you are doing the correct thing." Words like that, reassuringly uncertain.  The second is about a modernist American painter, Sam Glankoff, who had his first solo exhibition at the age of 87. (Then he died). A career as an artist requires patience, and I also needed reminding of that.  #takingawalk #serendipity #newyork #neilgaiman #samglankoff #books #whatpeoplethrowaway #makegoodart #makegoodartspeech
