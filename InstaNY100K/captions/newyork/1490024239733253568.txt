Good day, Instagram. We've been a bit quiet these past few days, but ready to get back to our daily schedule :) Today we were back  in Mount Sinai job to finish the railing and install iron balusters. Turned out great. Dont mind the black electrical tape, its our special way of securing the baluster shoe. #dkpstairsandrailing #railing #redoak #redoakrailing #redoakposts #raisedpanel #raisedpanelpost #newelpost #iron #ironbalusters #houseofforgings #longisland #nassaucounty #suffolkcounty #newyork #mountsinai #followus
