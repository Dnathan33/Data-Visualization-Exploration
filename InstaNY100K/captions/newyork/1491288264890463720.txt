This year @friezeartfair #NewYork we will be displaying a series of #prints by #AntonyGormley including this unique #monoprint, ‘Show II’, 2015-16. This work, measuring over 2 metres in height, is a print taken directly from the artist’s body composed of #crudeoil, linseed oil and petroleum jelly.  #FriezeNewYork opens 5 – 7 May. We will be exhibiting works on booth B46.
