Focus: It is difficult to have clarity on many things at once- there is beauty in an intense focus on the present, but having a view of the landscape, the forest and the trees, allows us to not only take the next step, but to get to where we  need to be in proper time and without extraneous efforts. This is a defined need for rationality-â€‹ what we feel right now, even in crystalline focus as if looking through a powerful lens, is not the credible guide for our long term success or happiness, as we are constantly bombarded with emotions, feelings, ideas, pains and heartaches which drive us from our true value. Instead, let us put in the time and work to have a plan, and have the grit to scale the walls, climb the cliffs, and continue moving rather than merely accepting obstacles as excuses for why we never made it to the party. ________________________________________________________________________________ #Stoics #Tuesday #Focus #sunlight #grass #photography #nofilter #PhotoOfTheDay #SonyAlpha #Sony #1Hotels #NatureIsArt #Miami #NewYork #Ibiza #A7Rii #Wisdom #Philosophy #Meditation #AlwaysBeLearning #AlwaysBeGrateful #AlwaysBeBuilding #TXP
