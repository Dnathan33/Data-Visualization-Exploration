"In 2014 I won Miss Rwanda USA. I did it because I felt like I found my purpose in life and that was when I went back to Rwanda for the first time since the genocide in 1994. When I went back I realized that I had to do something to help my country. I found out everything that my parents went through and the sacrifices they had made. When I ran, my goal was to help women with prenatal and postnatal care and also to advocate against genocide. So when I won Miss Rwanda USA I was able to travel to different schools and nonprofit organizations to speak on advocacy against genocide. And now, post-grad I am planning on helping women to find better resources for them to have prenatal and postnatal care."
