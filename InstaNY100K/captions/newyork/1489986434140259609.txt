~ #TimesSquare times ~ The city that never sleeps. The people that don't care. The land that accepted them all. The country with no culture? The city of a million dreams. The best city in the world. Perception, each one different from another. Perception of people who have been there, or haven't been. My perception? I felt being there then, I feel like being there now. #Perception #NYTimes #citythatneversleeps #NewYork #NY #NYC #bigapple #subway #iheartny #cityofskyscrapers #USA #Broadway #Lights #CityLights #NightLife #Walking #Holiday #Vacation #Break #Carefree #Life #Nofilter #nofilterneeded #Canon #Nightphotography #Unclicked
