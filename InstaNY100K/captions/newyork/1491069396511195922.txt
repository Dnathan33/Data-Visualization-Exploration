"Rebekah Rice is seeding plants she may never harvest, and she’s fine with that. “Adding medicinal crops is part of long-term diversification to make this farm financially successful for my granddaughter. I love the idea that in 120 years this farm may have a tree being harvested that I planted in 2017.” Rice is one of 32 small farmers in 23 counties across New York participating in a medicinal plant project funded by New York Farm Viability Institute. The project targets 50 species with an establishment-to-harvest range of one to 20-plus years.  Project leader Jean Giblette calculates that New York is a $30 million herbal medicine market — one that currently imports 100% of its product from China. “Chinese herbal medicine is a complex science using mostly perennial plants that are highly valuable when combined by licensed practitioners in individualized formulas,” explains Giblette, who has grown Asian medicinal plants on her own High Falls Gardens in the mid-Hudson Valley since 1994.  Her New York grower network is building its “fresh, locally grown” seed stock capacity aimed at supplying more than 3,500 licensed acupuncture and Oriental medicine practitioners in the state. Nine Mile Farm is one of them.  Rice farms 92 acres at Nine Mile Farm at Delmar with her father, 87-year-old Michael Rice. For them, medicinals production is a natural next step after 50-plus years of growing vegetables and cut flowers. “Working with medicinal roots, trees and herbs is compelling for me, not for any instant return but for a deeper value in the potential to grow plants that can help people,” she reflects..." #newyorkcity #newyork #naturespharmacy #herbalremedies #traditional #medicinal #farming #farmland #growyourownmedicine #helpothers #wellbeing #wellness #vancouver #toronto #portland #plants #plantlife #plantlove #healing #dreamjob #life #betterlife #bekind #sustainable #environment #motherearth #firstnations
