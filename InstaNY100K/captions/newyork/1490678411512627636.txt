Now in Stock > Ambrosia Volume 3: Brooklyn - Brooklyn, an incredibly diverse borough of #NewYork City, is many things to many people. It’s where the Ebbets Field and stickball-loving old New York meets young creative types obsessed with artisanship, where old school #Jewish #deli owners and #LatinAmerican vendors meet #chefs armed with tweezers in graffitied warehouses. In this issue, the borough’s great chefs—street vendors and guardians of hallowed centuries-old institutions, young guns and Roberta’s disciples—tell us, through their own words and #recipes, about one of the most influential and complex regions in the world, and what it’s like to #cook and #eat there in 2016. @ambrosiamagazine  Volume 3 eats its way through Brooklyn and brings you stories, photos, and light recipes from the New York City borough’s greatest chefs.
