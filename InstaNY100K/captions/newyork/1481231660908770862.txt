"A rare smile", 2016, c-print on aluminium by Swedish-Ukranian artist Nathalia Edenmont. For her most recent body of work she portraits women wearing exquisite dresses constructed of vegetables, flowers and seasonal fruits in order to create an astonishing metaphor on fertility and fecundity.  This photograph is on view at Edenmont's  solo exhibition "Fruitfulness", now at New York's Nancy Hoffman Gallery until May 13th.
