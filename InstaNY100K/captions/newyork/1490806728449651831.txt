Sara VanDerBeek's "Electric Prisms I-XII" series explores the transformative nature of photography as the same image is manipulated through variations in colour, contrast and density. The passage of time is conveyed by the physical sequencing of the images along the wall as the dark blues and purples of night give way to the hot pink of daybreak and continue on to the cool crepuscular mix of dusk.
