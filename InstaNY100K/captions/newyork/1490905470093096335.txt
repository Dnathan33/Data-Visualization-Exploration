Inexperienced companies regard marketing as medicine to be taken when something is wrong. (“Not enough customers? Take some marketing and call me in the morning.”) Instead, marketing should be viewed as food. It’s the regular, sustained nourishment that gets your business where you want it—and keeps it there. You need it throughout the day, every day. ------------------------------------------------ The single most important reason for engaging in active, ongoing marketing is simply that it secures your company’s future. Marketing creates business. You may have lots going on right now, but will it still be there in six months? A year? Three years? Savvy business owners don’t leave their future up to chance; they’re planting seeds now they can harvest next season. ------------------------------------------------ #genius #digitalmarketing #digital #entrepreneur #entrepreneurship #hustle #hustlehard #newyork #nyc #marketing #marketingdigital #marketingonline #jayoh #smallbusiness #consulting #entrepreneurs #entrepreneurship #entrepreneurlife #businessquotes #businessman #quoteoftheday #businesswoman #inspiredaily #marketingtips #marketingideas #marketingadvice #digitalmarketingtips #marketingplan #advertising #advertise
