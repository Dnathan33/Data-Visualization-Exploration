#TravelTuesday, you know, not only have I enjoyed going wherever & whenever, the Spirit of the God has led me to go, I have met some of the most #BeautifulPeople, along the way! These are photos from a time in my life, where I was mutually embraced & honored, by #Nigerians, as a part of the #AnglicanChurchOfThePentecost.  As you can see from the photos, I was truly #Blessed & #HighlyFavored in their presence. The cloth that you see me wearing was given to me & I was taken to one of their seamstresses, where I chose the style & the way I wanted to wear it. I attended an Inauguration of the Missionary Diocese of the Trinity, where there were hundreds of people from #Nigeria, wearing the same material in hundreds of styles! This was one of the most memorable moments of my spiritual life!  Soon after, I invited the Rev. Paul Aduba to meet my Father, who, as you can see, put on some African clothing he'd had & was given by one of his good friends in #NewYork. When the Rev. saw the quality of the material that my Father is wearing, he was in awe & called my Father a King. Up until that moment, I had no idea how much worth the material we were wearing held, with respect to the country of #Africa & I don't think my Father really did either.  #NeverTheLess, my Father has always treated me as #Royaltly, so much so, one morning, after waking up to the smell of breakfast, my Father was always cooking, jokingly, in my #ComingToAmerica voice I said, "Father, I am over 40, do you think perhaps just once I might cook my own breakfast?" Lol! Even still, whenever I visit home, some things will never change. With that being said, some people always wonder why I would leave a life they long for, while others seem to think the life I've lived is undeserving, for someone like me. Well, hey, my life just comes & goes to show, with whatever territory I'm in, I've learned, I'm worth a lot more!
