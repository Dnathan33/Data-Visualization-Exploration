Are you planning to visit NYC ? A Perfect NYC weekend is 1 seeing a live NY Yankee game in the Bronx or the Brooklyn nets 🏀 then 2 have some real soul food on the Malcolm X boulevard at #redroosterharlem (Obama's favorite restaurant) or Sylvia's in Harlem while 3 @voera is singing jazz/soul for you, then 4 run in the morning on the Brooklyn bridge, return to Harlem to 5 eat breakfast in @astorrowcafe , 6 shop in Canal street (soho) & 7 close the evening in a rooftop bar in midtown 🍃New York is once again on my bucket list this summer. Have some duties to organise over there before moving there📍 - - #love #photooftheday #bestoftheday #model #me  #traveling #fashion #blogger #instagood #instamood #instadaily #repost  #black #travelgram #melanin #blackgirlmagic #trend  #life  #Lifestyle #nyc  #travelblogger #newyork #broadway #blacktraveljourney #blackgirlswhoblog #blacktravelfeed #travelnoire
