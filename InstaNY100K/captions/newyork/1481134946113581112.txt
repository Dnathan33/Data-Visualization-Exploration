#AuctionCountdown A Ramachandran has ceaselessly experimented with visual language for more than 40 years. Painter, sculptor, graphic artist and designer, Ramachandran's vision and style has changed from sombre expressionism to lyrical and metaphysical engagement with nature. In the process, the artist has explored diverse scale and medium. His artwork above depicts a young tribal woman who wears the markers of her community a bright skirt and mantle, and silver jewellery about her ankles, wrists and neck. Fuelled by the possibility of creating sensuous and imaginary worlds using the vibrant colours and patterns found abundantly in Rajasthan, Ramachandran incorporated these indigenous decorative elements into his painting. His work is replete with the fabulous colours and fabrics with which the desert women clothe themselves.  A.
