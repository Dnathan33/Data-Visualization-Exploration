Yass for the 7th consecutive season, Rangers are going to the playoffs.  Despite the loss last night, I'm still proud. ❤💙 They really tried giving it their best. By the end of 1st period, Rangers were trailing 2-1, goal by JT Miller. By the end of the 2nd, we were still trailing 3-2 with a goal made by Derek Stepan. But in the 3rd, Fast and Miller were able to give up that 4-3 lead but the sharks tied. And we fell 5-4 in overtime. #nyr #nyrangers #newyorkrangers #blueshirt #blueshirts #blueshirtsunited #blueshirtsnation #blueshirtsproud #rangerstown #nyr90 #ny #newyorkcity #newyork #nyc #manhattan #msg #madisonsquaregarden #nhl #nationalhockeyleague #derekstepan #jtmiller #jesperfast #sanjosesharks #henriklundqvist
