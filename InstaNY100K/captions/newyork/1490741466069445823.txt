During his auspicious career, #fineart watercolor #artist, Tom Hill (b.1925) has crisscrossed the country, traveled, exhibited, taught his craft, written books and painted his way around the world! • He’s worked at @unistudios, served his country, was an artist/reporter for the @ChicagoTribune, illustrated for @nytimes, @ReadersDigest, @Redbookmag and many others. • While honing his craft as a working #illustrator, he attended @ArtCenteredu in #California, @artinstitutechi, and the #NationalAcademyofDesign in #NewYork. He’s taught over 600 workshops worldwide and has participated in hundreds of group or one-man shows.  He’s authored six books on painting, color and #travel. • “The world is your oyster” is more than a catchphrase for Tom.  It’s been a passionate pursuit ... a lifetime of living, learning, exploring, #painting and sharing.  Tom and his artist wife, Barbara, make their home in #Arizona. • #Watercolor #Painting #Art #NativeAmerican #Gallery #Museum #BashaCollection
