Lucky Break. ðŸŒˆ . After getting soaked trying to get a lighting shot during yesterday's afternoon storm, the sky opened up and blessed me with a surprise rainbow. (And yes, I think that's another rainbow on the right but let's not talk about it.) My first one over Manhattan. . Thanks to @jkhordi who happened to show up and convinced me to stick around for this shot. . And by pure chance, after this I ran into @underground_nyc who I been following for a long time but never met till now. . All in all, I lucked out. . . #nycprimeshot #ig_nycity #usaprimeshot #what_i_saw_in_nyc #newyork_instagram #rainbow #loves_nyc #icaputer_NYC #instagramnyc #nycdotgram #newyork_ig #canonbringit #made_in_ny #ilovenyc #nyc_explorers #rsa_streetview #topnewyorkphoto #instagood #canonphotography #photooftheday #ig_shotz #colors_of_day #hubs_united #superhubs #ig_exquisite #greatshotz #nycskyline #illgrammers #igs_america #ig_all_americas
