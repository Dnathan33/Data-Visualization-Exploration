Rest In Peace @ntlami, thank you for teaching us to live in the moment and fully. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽 . . .  Ontlametse Phalatse, a sufferer of the rare genetic disorder Progeria, which causes premature ageing, has died. Expected by doctors to only live until the age of 14, Phalatse last month celebrated her 18th birthday. She was the only known black female in South Africa born with this disease. . . .  #fashion #beauty #art #strategy #contentmarketing #partnerships #collaborations #experientialeventing #eventing #influencermarketing #marketing #campaignmanagement #pr #firm #johannesburg #southafrica #africa #newyork #northamerica
