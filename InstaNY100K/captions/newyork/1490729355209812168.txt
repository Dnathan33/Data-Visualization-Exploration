What does your circle look like? Stop hanging around that person or group of friends who always discourage you from achieving your goals. Here's a hint: they WISH they were you. They WISH they could achieve what you already have. Stop looking for gratification and satisfaction in others and find that within yourself. Its YOUR life, your purpose! ðŸ’•
