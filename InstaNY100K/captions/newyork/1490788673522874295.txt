At ALSC it's not our goal just to make great smelling soaps.  For instance, these four fantastic soap bars were designed with primarily your skin in mind.  This is solely to love the skin your in!! ALSC is always looking for new ways to give you the absolute best product we can.  I think that's why I love soap making so much.  It's constant trial and experiments, looking at  other cultures to see what their "secret" is.  It's so exciting!! SPRING IS HERE!!! Go outside and find some adventure you crazy kids!!!! #soap #soapmaking #cpsoap #coldprocesssoap #artisansoap #handmadesoap #savon #soapartist #handcrafted  #soapmakers #smallbatch #local #homemade #makersgonnamake #makersmovement #nontoxicbeauty #apothecary #soapbubbles #ilovesoap #brambleberry #lush #newyork #southampton #hamptons #local #etsy #etsyseller #etsyshop #etsycoupon
