April 7 2017 (Photo 5 of 5) Some shots from the inaugural annual New York City Alley Cats Race in downtown NYC and Brooklyn. The race was a free, bib-less, 5.5-mile, routeless, nocturnal run, tracked by Fitbit. Runners had to through as many set checkpoints as possible along the 5.5-mile distance, as fast as they can. I was at one of the checkpoints to catch some of the action. Just like alley cats, the runners appeared from multiple directions, at different times, running through pedestrians and traffic. In fact, I don't even know if any of the runners in my photos were Alley Cats, of just random runners.  I was confused, runners got lost; it was a challenging, fun, high energy shoot. I had to be alert, ready, fast, and at times I ran after a few of them to get the shots. I like the inexact blurriness of these photos. I much prefer these sort of shots that capture the chaos, speed, and rush of the race, as opposed to one where I am sitting around photographing runners go by. Thanks to @jdfnyc for organizing. . . . . . . . . . #letsgorun #running #runningcommunity #runforlife #runningculture #runnersworld #urbanrunning #nycrunning #nycrunners #justrun #runnyc #werunnyc #runnershigh #fitbit #stridesnyc #streetportrait #sportsphotography #sonyimages #sonyphotography #sonyalpha #nycphotography #thecity_life #streetactivity #bnw #blackandwhite #blackandwhitephotography #bnw_life #bnw_captures #jj_blackwhite
