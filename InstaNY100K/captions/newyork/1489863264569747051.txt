N E W  B E G I N N I N G S ! We've had a lot of changes here at TWR, Rohan has moved to New York and I'm now based out of the Mornington Peninsular. Exciting things are coming! What I can tell you is I will be starting tours up again this May, a few small changes and a new tour on the way!! And don't think you've seen the end of Ro either, he will be bringing you some way cool things from the other side of the globe!! Stay tuned for tours dates and news and all things TWR. Thanks for all you're ongoing support over the years. New beginnings will be here soon we promise... ðŸ’— Al
