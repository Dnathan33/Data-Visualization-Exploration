Two weeks of chaos, traveling, networking, failing, succeeding, hugs, high fives, and all the emotions. I wouldn't trade this for anything. So grateful to be able to do what I love to do and the support of family and close friends makes my dreams a reality. #neverstopexploring #newbeginnings #notonassignment #tidworkshop2017 #newyork #denver #travel
