------Visions of a Secret Admirer--------- I honestly didn't know if we'd  have anything in common... and quite frankly I didn't give  a damn.  The feelings inside me  that  have worked their way to  the tip of my tongue,  off of my lips,  and gently landed inside your right ear had to battle every ounce of logical objection I had.  You  received my message.  And that was  enough for me... I was no  longer a Secret Admirer.  I was no  longer lurking in your shadow.  #love #lovequotes #poetsofinstagram #poetsofig #poetrycommunity #streetlove #street #streetphotography #urban #urbanexplorer #nyc #newyorkcity #newyork #beauty #beautiful #lovely #instagram #instagood #igdaily #igers #whatinevertoldyou #muslimpoet
