Cyclone, carousels and kids. I watch them for a while. I've never been on a rollercoaster, i'd really like to try. Anyway, not alone. I keep walking towards the beach. Some sand raised by the wind, someone jogs along the shoreline. I stick to the promenade. I eat my very first hotdog at a nearby kiosk. It wouldnâ€™t taste like anything if it weren't for the ketchup.  #IGtakeover #cometogazebooksicily #fabrizioalbertini  #themeccaofconeyisland #NewYork #ConeyIsland #Handball
