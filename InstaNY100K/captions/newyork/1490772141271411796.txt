"Grateful" Pariss and I have been trying to link for some time now. Due to the universe path we always had to reschedule. 4/9/17 we were able to meet up and create. We shot at the Z lot with no concept but when two minds join together, ideas will form. I didn't have to tell Pariss pretty much anything, she got in front of camera and executed. While we were creating Pariss informed me of a poetry event and said she would be performing a piece. I was grateful for this moment because I know @highleigh_93 loves poetry. <===== To be continued ðŸ˜‰
