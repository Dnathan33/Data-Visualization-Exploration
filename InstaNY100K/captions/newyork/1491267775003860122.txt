DETAIL, INTERRUPTED FERN, 2011.  On the www.eclected.com  20x24" warm tone Black and White gelatin photograph. This closeup detail hand printed from an 8x10" film negative is stunning and hard not to dwell on. It also has a noticeable calming effect on the viewer. Archivally processed and mounted, matted and framed in elegant black metal Nielsen museum frames. A very contemplative piece. #eclected #eclected_online #photography #photograph #fineart #contemporaryart #ny #nyc #newyork #newyorkcity #art #home_decor
