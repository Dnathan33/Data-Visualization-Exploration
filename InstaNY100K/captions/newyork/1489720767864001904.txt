ðŸŒŸWhat do you like seeing?ðŸŒŸ I love painting and playing with new ideas, so it gets hard for me to stick to one particular style or medium.  I have a market I'd like to attend coming up and would love to show off some new pieces so the more inspiration the better! So let me know what've been your favourite things that you've seen from me, or what you'd like me to try with my own flair to it!
