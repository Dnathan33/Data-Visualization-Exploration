"If you can keep your head when all about you  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,  If you can trust yourself when all [wo]men doubt you,  But make allowance for their doubting too … If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;  If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;  If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster  And treat those two impostors just the same;  If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools … If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  Or walk with [Queens]Kings—nor lose the common touch … If you can fill the unforgiving minute  With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,  Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,  And—which is more—you’ll be a [Wo]Man, my [daughter]son!"
