Make Your Mark (MYM), Turner Construction's employee resource group for women in the New York office launched their new logo this year. Senior Project Manager & MYM Chair, Mary Mahany, shared that the network "want[ed] to convey the boldness and directness of our desire to make our mark as women in construction. And with the landscape and skyline, which is much more fluid and imprecise, we convey[ed] that each of us, singularly and collectively, has the power to transform the world we work in every day, with our approach.” 🏙 --- #turnerconstruction #turnerdifference #makeyourmark #womeninconstruction #constructionmanagement #engineering #architecture #newyork #ny #newyorkcity #nyc #skyline #diversity
