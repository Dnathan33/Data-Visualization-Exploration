I've never been to a city I didn't fall in love with, but none made me feel the way NYC did. It's indescribable, like you can be anything you want, do anything you want to do and yet you're just a tiny speck lost in this city that doesn't even know that you're born. I've never felt more alive or insignificant. And yet I long to return every day. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ #newyork #newyorkcity #nyc #bigapple #citythatneversleeps #statueofliberty #scenery #architecture #usa #america #travel #traveller #travelgram #wanderer #wanderlust #placestogo #placestovisit #adventure #explore #roadtrip #landscapephotography #sky #skyscraper #cityscape #love #live #traveling #inspire #summer #unitedstatesofamerica
