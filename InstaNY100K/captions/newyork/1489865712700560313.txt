One thing that I notice about most of the people who have been The Greatest in their platform is that they were often ridiculed, hated on, talked down about etc. In order to be great on your platform you have to be able to understand that everyone is not going to like you or support you. It's sad that a lot of former leadership has failed people in the sense of not teaching people how to live by good morals etc. With that being said, I've accepted the challenge to step up and lead in what is believed to be the right way and I'm now challenging you to do the same. I'm challenging everyone to start exercising speaking the best they possibly can on behalf of other people starting with yourself. If you don't like a person then find a positive way to say it and at the end add, "But I Wish Them The Best." You have to be willing to forgive others and want the best for them or how can you expect people to do the same for you?
