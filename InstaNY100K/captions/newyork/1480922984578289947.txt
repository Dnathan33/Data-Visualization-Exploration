ATLANTA CELEBRITY CHEF DELPHY !!! 🔥🔥 💯💯💯🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🍴🍴🍴🍴Chef Delphy (Franklin Robson Jr.) was born and raised in Queens, NY and began cooking and producing music at an early age.  His strong passion for both emerged at 9 when he began taking drum lessons and writing his first culinary recipes.  He perfected his craft in both areas working as the Head Chef in numerous restaurants throughout North Carolina and Georgia while honing his talents in the studio as a producer and recording artist.  In 2010 Chef Delph had the opportunity to open his first restaurant in Raleigh, NC called Smokin Grooves.  Here the culmination of both passions collided as his original culinary crafts were served with a music themed atmosphere showcasing an appreciation for various styles of Jazz, Funk, Hip-Hop, R&B and Soul music.  Soon the venue became a hotbed for not only great food but major events, parties, showcases and concerts.  The popularity of the restaurant’s great food and atmosphere became a hit with local residents as well as celebrities.  This led to an opportunity for Delphy to host his own cooking show “Itz Gravy Baby.” Here Chef Delphy interacts with various guest including celebrities in the kitchen cooking while discussing food, music and other topics.  Past guest include Big Daddy Kane, Slim from 112, Prince Po of Organized Konfusion and Mike G of the Jungle Bros.  Recently relocating to Atlanta to work with The Atlanta Hawks Organization Chef Delphy will be starting on a 2nd season of “Itz Gravy Baby.” With an upcoming cook book in the works as well as a new music project expect great things from Chef Delphy. . #cheflife #chefdelphyoso #chefdelphy #foodporn  #foodies #hungry #goodeats  #yummy #atlanta #newyork #houston #losangeles #bigdelph🎤 #bigdelphvh1 #bigdelphvh1 #bigdelphbet #bigdelph🎤 #brooklyn #bronx #backonmyshit #queensniggagettingpaper
