From the West Coast to the East Coast the blue family is strong. ðŸ’™  So honored to have this little Thin Blue Line flag shipping out to represent a family with the great NYPD.  I chose the heart as the same gold color as the badge.. and I said a prayer to protect this family.. to cover this officer with God's protection & to bring them home safe to their family after every shift. â™¥ðŸ’™â™¥ . . . #anchoredwooddesigns #woodenart #woodart #maker #shophandmade #customart #patriots #patriotic #america #american #thinblueline #hugacop #leowife #nypd #newyorkcity #newyork #lawenforcement #policeofficer #backtheblue #bluefamilystrong #igothis6 #policewifelife #webleedblue
