One Of The Most Mind-blowing Parts Of My Trip Was Seeing The World Trade Center Memorial. Humbling & Deep, The Sun Seemed To Shine Down Perfectly Over Everything. I Appreciate Everyone Who Sacrificed Their Time, Lives, & Everything Because Of That Day 🏙☀️🌎🙏. #neverforget #worldtradecenter #beauty #architecture #sunshine #photography #mywork #godbless #thanks #to #our #military #veterans #mom #brother #manhattan #newyork
