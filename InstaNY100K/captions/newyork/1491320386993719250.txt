"We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, & not in another; unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another. The past, present, & future mingle & pull us backward, forward, or fix us in the present. We are made up of layers, cells, constellations." _  #art #artgallery #artshow #fineart #gallery #nyc #newyork #sculpture #scopenewyork #stefanobombardieri
