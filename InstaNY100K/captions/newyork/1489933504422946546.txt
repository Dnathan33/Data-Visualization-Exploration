The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone To all colors increases, to home it belongs  want land, mansions, banks and gold The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control The world's natural resources, all its residuals But then comes foes, I have to gaurd it with missels And I become the most wanted But is it worth hearin a million people problems and followed by Secret Service I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel #Nas #Stillmatic #queens #hiphop #Rap #hiphophead #HIPHOPJUNKIES #music #realhiphop #hiphopforever #microphone #NewYork #lifestyle #rapgame #gangster #poetry #realrap #undergroundnyc #HIPHOPJUNKIE #knowledge #rapper #quote #graffiti #undergroundhiphop #underground #emcee
