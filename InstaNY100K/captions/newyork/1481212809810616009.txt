New York- .  I sat there on sheets of leather juxtaposed between pieces of gum kissing my familiar goodbye, They told me, "be safe" as they started to cry, . What they didn't understand was that I was on that "Empire State of Mind" high, Until I saw how many dreams die, . I photographed dead dreams on streets which told history, Which I had been told were colored by democracy . Democracy? Are you fucking kidding me? . Is this what you call the American Dream? Told by that clown whose hair looks like tangerine whip cream . No but seriously, is this closet that I'm in really what I saw on that T.V. Screen, Which preached about all I could possibly be? . How can this be? When all I see is inequality, Disguised by racialized systems of hierarchy . Is this what "Make America Great Again" really means? Eradicating all our dreams squeaky clean? . Dreams of who? Surely not the fortunate few! . Dreams that once could breathe, Much like grandma before she was tied up to that machine . Now she's dying because she has no green, Is this what you call the American dream? Is this really the Land of the Free? Because it seems to me that we are held in captivity behind bars of greed. .
