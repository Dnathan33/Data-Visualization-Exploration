My tip for this week is.... drink water! Yes it's that simple!!! Some studies show that it helps maintain weight and boosts metabolism!!! From not drinking enough you can experience body aches, muscle cramps and headaches! Water helps remove toxins from your body. One of my favorite things is that when you are hydrated your skin has that full healthy glow! I love feeling like I look younger!!! So drink your water!!!ðŸ˜œ
