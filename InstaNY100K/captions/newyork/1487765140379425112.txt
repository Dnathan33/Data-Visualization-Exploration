Phinney Design Group has undergone implementing the first major capital improvement at Silver Bay since the late 1970’s. A new 22 room lodge and conference facility designed to operate as an independent, year-round facility within the Silver Bay campus will be built in 2017. The facility will replace the current dining hall with modernized serving and food distribution systems capable of increasing the quality and experience of dining on the campus.  #newyork #saratogacountychamber #capregchamber #aianewyorkstate  #modern  #restoration  #renovation #ExploreSaratoga  #silverbay #silverbayymca #ymca #dininghall #gather #gettogether #retreat #wagnerhodgson
