Might be Taco Tuesday, but we tipped over to Bianco for some Pizza. Some say the best in the country. Top Five on most lists. Wise Guy up front with the House Smoked Mozzarella, Wood-roasted onion and Fennel Sausage from Schreinerâ€™s. Sonny Boy in the back (Mozzarella, Salami & Gaeta Olives). @pizzeriabianco  #newyork #phoenix #arizona #pizza #love #fornoalegna #tacotuesday #instafood #travel #foodpics #thincrust #all_shots #art #cheese #artist #beard #dtphx #pizzatime #eeeeeats #sausage #salami #chicagofood #mozzarella #cheesy #yum #pizzeria #woodfired #itailianfood #myfab5 #Bianco
