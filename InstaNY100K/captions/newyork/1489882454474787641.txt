NY-based Luke Temple, one of the core-members of lo-fi rock band Here We Go Magic, has been steadily releasing solo albums since 2005. 'A Hand Through the Cellar Door' is the latest addition to his track record, released in 2016 on the Secretly Canadian record label. His solo work has the lo-fi sound Here We Go Magic incorporates (or is it the other way around?), but this new release leans heavily on acoustic guitar loops over which Temple sings dreamily and tells stories of gruesome things happening to people (like a gun blasting in someones face or someone getting badly burned in a car accident). Often using his thin falsetto, making it an ethereal, folky record. The cover art shows Temple partly obscured by branches and twigs in a forest. Giving of a peaceful vibe. •———————————————————• #covart #looklikelisten #coverart #albumart #albumcover #luketemple #ahandthroughthecellardoor #herewegomagic #lofi #indie #rock #folk #secretly #canadian #secretlycanadian #secretlycanadianrecords #new #music #newmusic #album #record #ethereal #dreamy #peaceful #newyork #ny #nyc #usa #america
