I was tagged by the beautiful @juliablakeauthor for #spellyournamewithbooks It was a bit challenging but I managed to do it with books that not only spell my name, but represent me as well. I have: Rudegami - the book that taught me how to make my origami penis. How to be Parisian - reflecting my love of of Paris. One with You - a fabulous erotic romance. New York - a gorgeous book by one of my favourite illustrators. Desire - my big book of sexy stories and lastly, Audrey Style - one of my favourite ladies of all time. And all sandwiched between my gorgeous bronze Art Nouveau naked ladies bookends ❤ . #books #bookish #bookstagram #rudegami #howtobeparisian #onewithyou #sylviaday #newyork #meganhess #desire #sexystories #erotıcromance #audreystyle #audreyhepburn #bookends #artnouveau #bronze #bronzeladies
