Some 23 000 kilos of vegetables and herbs grow out of sight, high above the streets of New York. These luscious crops are carefully tended by Brooklyn Grange, the leading U.S. urban farm and the world’s biggest producer of seeds from plants not grown in the ground .  Want to learn who do plan an urban vegetable garden, how to cultivate mushrooms, how to make natural soap, or perhaps you’d like to get an intro to beekeeping? And all this whilst experiencing the Big Apple and the region .  Get in touch with us and we will tailor an exclusive tour for you .  #instagood #tripstagram #holidays #holiday #dovolenka #cestovanie #dnescestujem #worldtrip #worldtravel #endlessadventure #dailypic #adventure #tour #travelstagram #trip #travel #travelphotography #newyork #USA #farminga
