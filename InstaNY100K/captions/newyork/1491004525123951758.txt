🖤Tuesdays are quickly becoming my favorite day of the week. I'm teaching a free class at @dumboloft for @green_desk and it's just filled with genuine souls looking to improve their fitness & wellness from the inside out. Tonight the mix was 50/50 male and female fit and not with a wide range of ages and stages, including my 10 year old son 🙌🏻truly, nothing makes my heart happier than supporting and assisting the journey of connecting with your body rather Jan feeling at the mercy of it. This physical experience is such a gift, as challenging as it may be at times, it's an honor to work with it and it's my joy to teach and guide to that joy. If you're in #newyork and want to come to class, for free, comment or message me. 🖤we've got a gorgeous, large space. There's so much room for anyone willing to engage.
