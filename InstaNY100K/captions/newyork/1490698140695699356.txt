Sorry I've been so MIA lately everyone, but my next adventure awaits! This weekend I'll be exploring New York City and Philadelphia! Two cities I've never been to, two cities full of delicious food! Kind of on a limited time frame, as we have a lot of sights to see, but tell me your favorite spots? I'm looking for can't miss places, your favorite hole in the walls, foods you can't find anywhere else! Comment below with your favorite spots! #newyork #newyorkcity #philadelphia #philly #philadelphiapa #foodie #thegingerfoodie #travelingfoodie #foodblogger #foodieblogger #blog #blogger #tellmeyourfavoritespots #wheretoeat #whattoeat #nyfoodie #phillyfoodie #rhodeislandfoodie #massahusettsfoodie #newenglandfoodie #wheretoeatny #wheretoeatphilly
