Tarab NYC mission: We support collective and individual struggle against discrimination and other forms of oppression; therefore, we strive to create safe spaces and empower our members by fostering an inclusive environment free of racism, heterosexism, misogyny, zionism, religionism, agism and classism. We work within MENA (Middle Eastern and North African) communities to reduce stigma towards queer people and within queer communities to reduce stigma toward people of MENA decent. We envision this work taking place through dialogue with leaders and broader community discussions. We are non-sectarian and secular; we respect all religious and non-religious backgrounds as equal. We do not believe in reinventing the wheel, but rather in creating opportunities to partner or work in solidarity with community groups and organizations that align with our values and further our mission. We speak only on behalf of Tarab NYC and we never claim to represent everyone in our community. We organize ourselves through a non-hierarchical leadership board that strives to represent the diversity of our community and is accountable for its actions. We believe that our rich cultural histories, past and present, are important to our lives. We are committed to supporting artists and creative projects within our community. We believe we should always make time to have fun and enjoy ourselves. #Tarabnyc #tarab #lgbtqarabs #arabslgbtq #arabong #arabassociation #menalgbtq #lgbtq #mediterraneanlgbtq #mediterraneelgbtq #lesbians #transgenders #bisexuals #usa #usalgbt #usalesbians #americanarabs #newyork #newyorklgbtq
