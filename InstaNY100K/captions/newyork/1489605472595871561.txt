Here's a post about the four senior cats I pulled from the Rosenburg shelter last weekend for @frankiesfelinefund and @puppykittynycty - I flew Amber and Tybee to NYC and the two white brothers are with @hoops_mom4 in houston until they get well. Fosters and forever homes needed! *****UPDATE ON THE FOUR KITTIES FROM TEXAS! The girls, who were already flown to NYC, are at the vets office and not home yet. We usually quarantine for two weeks to make sure they are safe to be around other cats. We also want to make sure Amber is not diabetic - updates to come on that. The boys have been to the vet in Texas. Bart, the healthy one, is doing great. Barry, who was sick when we got him, is doing better. The vet thinks he has severe arthritis in one front leg. He got a steroid shot yesterday to help with inflammation and an arthritis injection. Bart is on antibiotics for URI but the blood work for both the guys came back great. The vet has told us no travel for two weeks, but we'll get them to NYC once we get the OK! Will need a foster when we get them up here! Interested in this handsome duo or the two girls?
