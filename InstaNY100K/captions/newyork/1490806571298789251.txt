When in Rome, do as the Romans do... Or in this case, when in NY, do as New Yorkers do. The MTA subway system is how New Yorkers get from point A to point B on a daily basis. Trains have regularly scheduled departures that are posted on kiosks inside of each station and there are also @mtanyctransit maps available to help you plan your trip.  For those who plan on visiting New York in the near future, how many of you will be taking the subway?
