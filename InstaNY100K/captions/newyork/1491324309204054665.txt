New York is always moving, growing and changing. People and places we thought of as unyielding are gone in an instant. Those we thought would never last become permanent fixtures.

Like any person, you learn to appreciate it more when you know you won't have much time left together. The countdown to California starts now. 48 Days ðŸŒƒ  #newyork #building #architecturephotography #manhattan #instagood #instadaily
