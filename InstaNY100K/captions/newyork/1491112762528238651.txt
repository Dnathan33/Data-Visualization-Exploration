#Throwback to that 5am flight @disney_marie_ & I took to New York last week. - We were at the airport by 3:30 am, after working until 12:30 am. 1.5 hours of sleep. - The sun was coming up over the tarmac as we were taking our seats on the plane. - I usually only post about the fun stuff, or at least try to make it interesting/entertaining, but there's a huge part of this lifestyle that does just plain suck. - But the more it sucks, the less competition there is. - Finding the bright side in less than ideal situations is a huge advantage, mindset counts for a lot when creative solutions are needed. - I choose this path because I love the challenges, and the rewards. - I built @industry_threadworks because I'm good at it, and being effective makes me feel fulfilled. - No matter what path you choose, things will still suck sometimes. - You just have to find the path that has the rewards that make it worth the sacrifice. - It's usually about more than simply money, it's about purpose, and meaning.
