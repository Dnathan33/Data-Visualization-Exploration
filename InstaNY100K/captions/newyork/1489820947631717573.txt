Lunch prep for later: is the "piece de resistance". Having venison lasagne made with @ethans_cauliflower flatbread for the noodles. I saut√©ed organic grass fed venison from @silverfernfarms from New Zealand that I bought @foodkick, onion, garlic, oregano in ghee then mixed with marinara  sauce. I cut the @ethans_cauliflower flatbread to fit in the casserole pan and used as noodles. I layered the venison meat sauce on top of the first layer of flatbread noodles. Then added a layer of saut√©ed mushrooms, spinach and basil and @miyokos_kitchen vegan & dairy free mozzarella made from cashews. Finally placed the second layer of the @ethans_cauliflower flatbread noodles on top with some more marinara sauce and @olli_salumeria nitrate free fennel pollen salami. I baked for 25 minutes covered with foul at 375 degrees. Then another 15 minutes without foil. It's is sooo flavorful and nutrient dense. Venison is the most iron rich and lean of all meats , plus I've added spinach for more iron and a side of steamed broccoli. ‚ö°Ô∏èüí•üëä made with Paleo friendly and nutrient dense ingredients. #paleo #primal #paleonyc #paleodiet  #paleo #paleolife #paleoeats #paleocooking #paleoliving #paleolife #paleofoodie #paleolunch #lunch #paleoapproved #paleofriendly #glutenfree #grainfree #wheatfree #lowcarb #cleaneating #healthy #healthyfood #healthyeating #healthiswealth #healthylifestyle #cavemandiet #fitforlife #newyorkcity #newyork #nyc  #venison
