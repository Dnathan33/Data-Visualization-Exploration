Looking back at some of my older work I decided to do a Throwback portrait week. Here I post some images that bring me back to a time not so long ago. Where I can reflect on my skill level at the time. Reflect on some of the friends and strangers I've met. Like this is Doug man he was such a cool dude. Had a lot of confidence in himself and was just an overall great guy. Miss ya brother and hope we can connect again soon. . . . This maybe a long week but should be worth it just foe the memories. . . . Leica in DC . . . #throwbackportraits #positiveimagesofpeopleofcolor #positiveimagesofus
