#VeganNY So this is Day 1: we take the precaution of preparing some sandwiches for our day our at the Statue Of Liberty using the prized possessions we caught from #FoodEmporium#HellsKitchen. Groceries in NY are EXPENSIVE so we thought we better use them. Not only are @followyourheart and @the_tofurky_company products amazing, they're very nutritious and sustaining. However, we really didn't need to pack our own food because, as we were just about to find our - NY RULES! You can get vegan food everywhere!  Stay Tuned...... #Manhattan #NY  #newyork  #crueltyfree  #veganism #vegan
