#AuctionCountdown  Lot #42  S. H. RAZA Nidhi Acrylic on canvas, 1994 24.0 x 24.0 inches  The painting by S. H. Raza in lot 42 features the bindu or cosmic void at the centre, surrounded by upward and downward triangles, signifying the female and male principles. In this work, it is in the use of colour that the colourist Raza triumphs. The bold, primary tones burst with a suffusion of energy. Even though the imagery is tightly contained, there is a primal force that it exudes that is at least as strong as the philosophy and ancient learning on which it is based.
