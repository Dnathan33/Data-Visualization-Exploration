Inspired by the revolt: one woman artist a day who has pushed against the system to express herself as an artist. Today: Roni Horn - who has explored the very nature of art and what it can do to us as viewers, challenging our points of view and perceiving her via her work.  Dave Hickey wrote in an essay about the artist with reference to her AKA portrait photography series: “In two photos, Horn looks like a lesbian. In one, she looks like a man. Like gels on spot lights, these images contribute their own tonality.  What’s missing is the ground zero of Horn’s narcissism… resisting ‘pretty pictures’…Horn’s internal narrative expressed here by her external change” (2016, Chicago Uni Press, pp133). The beautiful bleakness of Iceland, where she has spent a lot of time, has contributed towards her visual typography of water as the dynamic life source.  And furthermore how people interact or reflect that landscape.  Her Key and Cue sculpture series explores that gap between us as viewers and her as the artist, what we perceive and she feels.  No.288, the question reveals itself as one walks around the aluminium bar propped up against the gallery wall: “I’m Nobody! Who Are You?”. That question/statement was taken from Emily Dickinson’s poem (1891). Roni Horn has collected her letters and poems and worked with them for alongside her own work for many years.  The poem that No.288 takes from goes on to say Then there's a pair of us! Dont tell! they'd advertise - you know! How dreary - to be - Somebody! How public - like a Frog - To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog! In this frenetic world, she returns us to stillness and questions exactly what we are doing when we strip all the domestic noise away.
