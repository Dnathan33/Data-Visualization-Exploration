How's that for a classy looking can? Named after the Paramount Theater in downtown Peekskill, Paramount Pale Ale deserves its beautiful packaging. Bursting with pineapple, mango, lemon and grapefruit, there's a ton of flavor for just a pale ale. Medium bodied and crisp with a touch of bitterness, it would make for an incredibly enjoyable sessionable beer. With Other Studio crushing the artwork and Peekskill crafting fantastic brews, the art of beer has never been so multi-faceted.
