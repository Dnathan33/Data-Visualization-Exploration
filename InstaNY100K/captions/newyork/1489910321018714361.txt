URGENT-AT RISK FOR EUTHANASIA-FOSTER DESPERATELY NEEDED!!#DONTKILLME #DONTLETMEDIE @Regrann from @nycscr -  Diesel has not been reserved and time is running out. We were asked to help this dog as he is known by someone who reached out to us. We can't save him unless there's a home to put him in. Diesel is NEW HOPE RESCUE RATED ONLY. If you can help him please apply with us! ***A SPECIAL PLEA*** Diesel is at the NYCACC and we would love to save his life.  Diesel is a beautiful dog who was taken to the Brooklyn shelter last week by his owner due to a bite. There seemed to be some sort of injury on Diesels leg and when the owner went to examine him, he got bit. Was Diesel in pain? Did the human grab him in a way that his natural response was to react? So now Diesel may pay with his life because he is misunderstood. Diesel needs a lot of mental and physical exercise, something he sounds like he was not getting. He lived with other dogs, and it seems females are a better match for him. He also lived with cats and ignored them. This dog is no doubt traumatized, trembling next to the handler at the shelter, looking for reassurance.  Diesel does NOT have much time. He is New Hope Rescue only.
