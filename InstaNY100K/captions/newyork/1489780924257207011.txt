Years ago I was approached by someone who asked me to be apart of his dance. I remember the rush I felt as I was actually making a difference and had purpose as a dancer. Today those same people created one of the most powerful dance companies in El Paso with nothing more than a dream. A dream that we could make a difference. To be better than what people made us out to be.  I couldn't ask for better role models, mentors, and friends.  Over the years we have grown and lost many dancers we hold dear and that are irreplaceable. But found more hungry dancers wanting to make a difference. I am so honored to say I have danced beside each of you and honored to say at least one time in my life that "I was a Human Nature dancer". Thank you for these memories. #dancelife #dance #dancer #show #talisman #ballet #contemporaryart #contemporary #nyc #ny #la #newyork #newyorkcity #losangeles  #artist #humannature #art #passion ##humannaturecontemporaryballet
