A BIG thanks to this person pictured here. My first #nyc experience was a fucking blast, and only because of you @devinjackets . Cheers 🍻 to us and the adventures to come. Do you remember that time I dunked my phone into a pond? 😂 #streetfood #halal #shitwasgood #yourewelcome #newyork #iphoneiswaterproof #slayingdragons
