"To the world you may be one person, but to one person you may be the world" - - - This photo is dedicated to the great group of kids I met at the Pomonok playground. Thank you for a fun afternoon filled with dancing, freeze tag, hopscotch lessons and pizza. It's little moments like these that remind me I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be.
