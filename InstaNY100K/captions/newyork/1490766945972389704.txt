Classic Milk Tea Location: Boba Guys 🍃: The emphasis on natural and from- scratch ingredients is a huge plus. The tea had a noticeable flavor and had no artificial sweetener taste to it. The cream was whole milk and I was actually impressed by how thick and creamy the drink was, considering it's a real milk and not powder. One thing I noticed while sipping was that there was a subtle heavy dairy aftertaste. Almost like sweetened condensed milk. ⚫️: Again, the boba were actually a bit smaller than I'm used to in Cali, but had a good texture and were consistent. The flavor was more starchy.
