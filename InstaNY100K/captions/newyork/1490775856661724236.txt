Do you prefer Paris or New York? Honestly before living in Paris I have always preferred my stays in NYC, but now since I live here I love Paris more than I used to do as a tourist. So I love both of them, each city has its own charm üíô‚ù§Ô∏è If you have never visited one of them you have to it's a MUST!! . . . #nyc#paris#thebigapple#towereiffel#toureiffel#blogger#moroccanblogger#marocaine#france#travelphotography#naturephotography#parisart#parisjetaime#parismonamour#parisian#newyork#newyorkcity#nyclove#nyclover#nyciloveyou#seine#humansofnewyork
