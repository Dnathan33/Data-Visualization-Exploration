I feel bittersweet to say goodbye to NYC, my wonderful home for the last 4 years. After a long consideration of opportunities, I am ecstatic to say that I will be joining Walmart's team as Senior Manager, Investment & Pricing Strategy and moving to Arkansas!! ðŸ™ˆ Quite the change, I know. I've met with so many different companies and this company by far has blew me out of the water with their strategic goals to stay competitive and their dedication to grow me as a professional. When I was working for Burberry in my beginning stages of my career, someone I looked up to told me that one key ingredient is to find a mentor...so that's what I sought after. I went to New York & Co and found the best teachers and mentors I could've asked for - my manager, my VP, and so many other colleagues both up and across the organization. I'm excited to meet and work with my new team at Walmart and hope to meet more mentors like I've been blessed with to become the professional I strive to be in the future. "Better safe than sorry" might work in certain scenarios, but if I had tried to be safe all the time, I am sure I would not be where I am today.  So here's to new beginnings!  Sincere thank you to every single individual who have been mentoring, supporting and challenging me to become my best self.
