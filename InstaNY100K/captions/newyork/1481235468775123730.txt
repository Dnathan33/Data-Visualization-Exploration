Eating shakshuka at the #chelseamarket in #nyc yesterday. And the building ğŸ”¥CAUGHT on FIRE! ğŸ”¥5th & 6th floors billowing smoke and filling the street. ğŸ’¨ğŸ’¨Tons of fire trucks. The whole nine yards. Luckily this #shakshuka was totally worth it ğŸ˜‚. #travel #ttot #newyork #newyorkcity #delicious #nomnom #yum #ontheroad #bsweddinginthecity2017
