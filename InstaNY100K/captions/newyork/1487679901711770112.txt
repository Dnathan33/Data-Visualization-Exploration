Congratulations to our March #ICEProStudentPhotoContest winner @pablomorenodlf, who won us over with this photo of his last day of class in the Pastry Arts program — featuring Chef Jeff, Chef Penny and ICE Admissions rep Jock Grundy. Pablo will receive a $100 gift card for @diginn! #ICEstudents — keep sharing your best snaps from class! We love seeing what you're up to and what gets you excited about ICE, and our contest continues on: the next winner will be announced on May 7th!
