13 reasons why. This show is easily one of the best shows on Netflix. I hop3 it helps with bullying. From the 6th grade to the 12th grade I was bullied. Called ugly, made fun of for having a different nose, called gay, made fun of for being from new york, they talked about how I dressed, I was threatened, and called all types of names. I was robbed multiple times, had my lunch money taken, couldn't like white girls or any girl at that without be made fun of. I was almost jumped, and had trust issues cuz all the kids I thought were my friend wasn't. I was shy so no one wanted to talk to me until I had a girlfriend. I have a hand full of friends now and but I went through hell and back. From nightmares to anger. From pain to tears. I had to find myself. If i was to do it all over again I'd tell myself be you. Friends come and go and all you need is family and God. If y'all didn't know now you know.  #stopbullying #memes #art #like4like #post #dmv #newyork #begreat #new #newartist #newmusic #followhim #likeall #follow4follow #heat #support #indie #hiphop #follow #instagood  #cali #instapic #photoshoot #graphicdesign #views #like #wensday
