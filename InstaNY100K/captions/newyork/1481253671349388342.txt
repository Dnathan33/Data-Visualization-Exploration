A few weeks back 12 Gazelles travelled to Manhattan, New York to compete in the New Balance High School USA Indoor Track & Field Nationals. VERY High Level Meet. Put it this way...we witnessed the World Junior 60m Boy's World Record being Smashed. The Meet is THAT GOOD. Lots of Gazelles ate Humble Pie that weekend. Some Gazelles established new PB's and a few made the Top 8 in the USA. We had a great experience and got closer as a team.  We continue to get better as The Summer Season Approaches....Stay Focused Gazelles!! ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ”¥ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ğŸ”¥ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ”¥ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ğŸ”¥ğŸ‡ºğŸ‡¸ğŸ”¥ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦ #USA #Canada #HumblePie #RealityCheck #GazelleGang #TimesSquare #Fun #TeamTrip #SpringBreak #NewBalance #NBNationals #TheArmory #ThankFul #Blessed #GodsPlan #PorterAirlines #TrackAndField #TrackNation #Spring #Summer #OFSAA #HumblePie #NewYork
