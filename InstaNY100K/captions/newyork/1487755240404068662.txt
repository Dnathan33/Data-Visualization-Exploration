Brooklyn is beautiful too. Yoga class at Mister Rogers will be on Monday this week! 8pm, $5-10 donation. 231 Rogers Avenue. ðŸŒ¸ I know I alwaaaays do dancer's pose, but it makes me happy. It allows me to backbend, balance, and express outward all at once. Let's do more things that make us happy. ðŸŒ¿ ðŸ“·: @schneurmenaker #dancerspose #yogaeverydamnday #yogaclass #yoga #backbend #balance #express #expressyourself #natarajasana #dowhatmakesyouhappy #happy #prospectpark #cherryblossoms #cherryblossom #tree #brooklyn #beautiful #grassisgreen #newyork #nyc #springtime #primavera
