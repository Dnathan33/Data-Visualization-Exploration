The @brooklynshoespace taught the best Espadrilles class. Their fantastic, experienced team hit it out of the park with teaching their students how to design & make their very own pair. It was really fun to see everyone's personality shine through their shoes! {Hence this fabulous pair made by awesome little brother @ahwinski}. You all were such great teachers! . @sweetpaulmagazine #sweetpaulmakerie2017 #sweetpaulmakerie #brooklyn #newyork #creativity #crafting #craft #creativeretreat #creative #shoes #handmade #awesome #blue #brother
