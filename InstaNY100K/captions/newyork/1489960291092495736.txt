Quick one this morning. I like it but have to get the lines more in tuned with each other. Also reaching out to all street artists. If there is anyone who could teach me the ropes of spray paint I want to start throwing these down on walls. Please reach out. Or perhaps of you are well versed on street art and have the skill maybe you can throw down one of my designs somewhere ? #art #artist #painter #dapper #dope #raw #rad #style #swag #modern #modernart #fineart #collector #gallery #jerseycity #newyork #drawing #illustration #inkdrawing #abstract #abstractart #abstract #sketch #graffiti #streetart
