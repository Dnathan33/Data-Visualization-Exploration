I arrived at Clarks Restaurant a few minutes after it closed. It's isn't a 24/hr diner. I took a few shots including this one through the window. Luckily I caught him attention and he was nice enough to unlock the door and let me in for a few more photos. That's Brooklyn hospitality for ya! #dinersofnyc #diner #dinerdecor #brooklyn #bklyn #clarksrestaurant #nyc #nyceats #nycfoodie #newyork #newyorkcity #foodieofinstagram #kindness #nofilter
