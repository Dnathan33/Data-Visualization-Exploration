I just finished painting this. Let me tell you that the paper that you paint on makes a huge different regardless what level your skill is. This is the cheapest paper because I ran out of good paper. Usually I use @archescoldpress. And I am waiting until Michaels go on sale off 60% of regular item to buy them.  But since I do a lot of practice - this is a good choice because it is inexpensive and I paint everyday.  So when you paint next time consider the paper as well. If you a budget saver like me, if I know I am still in practice skill I use the cheapest paper otherwise its okay to use the good quality one. And not only that - you can feel  while painting it feels good while running your color on the brush and onto the paper also it absorb much more beautiful. While the cheap one creates a blob of water that you can see on my painting above.  Having said that - I am back painting peony this spring summer. I feel like I need to at least master one, two or three different shapes of peonies. Gahhh....😍😛😃 @lukasfarben . . #watercolorflorals #watercolorflowers #botanicalwatercolor #art_we_inspire #watercolour_gallery #watercolorist #longislandny #newyork #newyorkartists #ellyaart #longislandnyart
