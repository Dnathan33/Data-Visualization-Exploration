Spring in New York. I had landed a few hours prior, highly jet lagged after a 16hour flight and my brother brings me here.  I admired the the blossoming trees while sipping on @tobysbrooklyn mocha in 2015.  #Spring #NewYork  #tobysestate  #wanderlust #coffee #mocha #trees #nature #season #ilovenewyork #tobyslic #fnb #footprints #blueskies #travel #travelgram  #photooftheday #instagood #girl #lonetraveller #love #instalike #streetsofnyc #summer #ilovemybrother :)
