Was able to sneak in a super quick #legday workout over my lunch today. Remember, not every workout has to be your best. Don't let time be an excuse to skip what you DO have time for. It's a beautiful day in NYC though, so I might suggest doing the opposite of me and getting out to enjoy a workout in the park!
