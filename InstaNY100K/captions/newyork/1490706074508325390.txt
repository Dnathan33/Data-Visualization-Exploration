#TravelTuesday ✈️ What an eventful weekend in New York City/Jersey🗽 Meeting so many #NYCBloggers + building true connections was phenomenal. Next stop is #Atlanta for the next @blackbloggersunited event this month 👀 My favorite part of traveling? Switching up the atmosphere, clearing your mind + just taking a break even if it was only for a split second✨
