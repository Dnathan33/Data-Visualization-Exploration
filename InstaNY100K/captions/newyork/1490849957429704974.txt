Just two FEARLESS GIRLS here...She's even more beautiful in real-life. Fearless is not the absence of fear. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. Fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Be #fearless my girls! It's way more fun! #babecation #girlslovetravel #fearlessgirl #igotthistattooed #newyork #womenintheworld #womenempowerment #theworldisourplayground #wishlunawashere
