A column in the February 1949 Columbia Alumni News lamented the lack of a properly defined color, and set about to investigate. The magazine noted that it used a shade of turquoise for its cover, that the University had adopted a shade called azure for the University Shield, and that on top of that "there are the variegated blues of programs, announcements, and invitations. There is no single Columbia blue." In the same column the curator of Columbiana described the color as "the blue of the sky close to the horizon on a clear day," but confessed that "Oh, I just tear off the a piece of the cover of the University catalogue" when requesting the color from printers, and Columbia University Press's printing office simply stated that "why, we just ask for Columbia blue." It's worth noting that the historical range of Columbia Blue in its various uses has run from Cyan to Azure, to more subdued shades of Cornflower blue.
