One of several images based on Lolita by my student Taylor Pelton. So many good paintings, probably my favorite detail.  am so proud of my class, every student was included in the show, Beautiful Losers! I plan to go back with a good camera and will post more work soon.  #art #fineart #illustration #sva #junior #year #student #competition #show #chelsea #newyork #nyc #schoolofvisualarts #pictorialproblems #oilpaint
