We have finally been graced with true spring weather here in NYC! The  little ones got to embark on a mini adventure (across the street 🙃☺️), where they played with bubbles, painted the slabs of concrete with water (it's private property😫😭) and got to hang out with some of their loved ones before our usual dismissal time! Being a city kid isn't always easy, so it's nice to have a space for them to get some fresh air and run around ❤️ . . . . . . #learning #explore #newyork #newyorkcity #spanishimmersion #internationalbaccalaureate #children #babies #toddlers #toddler #montessorikids #montessorihome #teachersofinstagram #teacher #outdoors #watercolor #water #bubbles
