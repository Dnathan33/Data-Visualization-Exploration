This famous bottling of #Glenfiddich was bottled in 1991 and limited to an incredible 500 bottles, in the early 1990s. The release was restricted to only nine casks laid down originally in the 1930s, one cask was laid down for each of William Grant's nine children. After laying undisturbed, these nine casks were bottled on the July 26th, 1991 and presented in a hand made oak box with a brass plaque.  #whiskygents #gentlemen #vancouver #london #california #scotland #toronto #newyork #scotch #singlemalt #scotchwhisky #kentucky #bourbon #whisky #whiskey
