So much accomplished today. We learned Putin is our friend. Rode bikes. Lounged in Central Park. Creeped on other people's dogs during #nationalpetday. Walked in circles. Marveled at Kandinsky. Righted the original @magnoliabakery's wrong with a trip to @bloomingdales (where the frosting was generous). And took a time out in #timessquare. #snavelygalsandthecity #newyork #springbreak
