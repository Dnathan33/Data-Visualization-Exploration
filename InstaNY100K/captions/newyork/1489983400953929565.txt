Every episode of our show begins with an intro in which we showcase #Vancouver #graffiti. I've always been a huge fan of this #hiphop element. So while in #newYork it was great to find the 25+ years strong paint supply store #scrapyard. So much of the heart of #NY lies in the #bombs #throwups and #tags  you can stop and admire in alleys and on walls. @scrapyardnyc #streetart #nyc #robotswillkill #crash #zephyr #phase2 #keithharing #sanesmith #boogiedownproductions #bdp #inittospinit
