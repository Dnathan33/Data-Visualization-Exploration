We have a very disturbing update on Big Ricky.. X-rays of Ricky's hind legs show fractures in both of his femurs, meaning he was intentionally hit or hit by a car months ago.  The fractures are old and at this point we are not sure what can be done. When we first saw the video, we were sure Ricky's gait was due to "cage feet"- being crammed in a small area for an extended period of time, never did we think it was due to broken bones.  Ricky came from a hoarding situation and after a cruelty investigation was brought to a high kill shelter. We really do not know how this injury occurred to poor Ricky but we are angry. The pain that this poor dog has endured is just so unfair. All we want is to make him well again! Stand with us and help Ricky! He will need surgery or amputation of one of his back legs. We plan to bring him to NY for an evaluation with our board certified surgeon to figure out what can be done. Please help us help Ricky by donating to his medical care!!
