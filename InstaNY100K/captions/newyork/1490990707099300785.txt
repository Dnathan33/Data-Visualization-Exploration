I work 12 hours straight during the week and I'm dead exhausted by the time I get home. But it's leg day though, so best believe I'm still going to walk my ass to the gym ğŸ™ƒ Ya better have gotten your workout in today, no excusessss! The real question here though is team calves or team no caves ğŸ¤”
