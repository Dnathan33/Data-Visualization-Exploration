New York - a city that never sleeps. There is the same feel in Almaty too, wouldn't you agree? Besides New York is also, known as "The Big Apple" so there is a similarity with our "City of Apples". Love this quote and have prepared it for you to wish you good night in Almaty! üåè‚ú® Warm greetings from New York & sending you lots of love.
