Rule #1 for Aussies coming to Katz's: order the pastrami on rye, not the reuben. It's mainly known for the former, which is brilliant (the meat, not the rye bread). I'd also recommend a knish, some Dr Brown's celery soda and an eggcream. You probably won't like the eggcream (I love it) but it's the legit NY deli experience.
