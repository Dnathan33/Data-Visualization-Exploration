I dig the way street art is not only encouraged here but done in a collaborative way bringing artists, teachers, community and children together so as to promote history and educate all of the heritage of their communities and significant leaders. Very cool. Very simple. Extremely effective.  #art #empowering #education #streetseries #StreetArt #mural #dreambig #newyork #nyc #brooklyn #streetsofnewyork #graff #graffiti #streetstyle #streetphotography
