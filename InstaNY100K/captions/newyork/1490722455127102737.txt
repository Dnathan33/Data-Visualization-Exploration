Turning left over Mont Blanc (MOBLO) routing to Roma FCO . When flying in twilight and night is about to fall you can see "night" approaching from the East and it looks like a darkish line which starts at the horizon and as time progresses the line gets bigger and bigger until it passes overhead. You are now flying in the dark. It's a very impressive sight and one you can only see from high up in the sky. It's also impressive because often while you fly in twilight you see the night approach from the East (looking left from the flightdeck) while the sun is just about to dip under the horizon in the west (right of the flightdeck) ✈️✈️✈️✈️ ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ 📷↔Follow us @theairliners to Stay Updated 📷 The Aviation News Straight Off the Runway ✈✈ ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ 📷 To Post Your Aviation Pictures or Videos Tag them with hashtag #theairliners 📷 ➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖➖ Pic by @justaflyingdutchman 👏👏
