I LOVE when we step outside the box! ðŸ”²ðŸ’–ðŸ–¤ Be free. Be YOU!  STYLE SESSION: @bumbleandbumble  Prep: Tonic lotion to soften the hair. I always prepare the hair before adding product to give a better style that lasts, looks and feels great, and it allows for less product usage. Style: Styling lotion for shine and medium hold, and Thickening Hairspray at the root for lift. Finish: Brillantine for a brilliant shine and a pieced separation. Add Does It All Hairspray for a finished hold.  #pinkhair #rosehair #violethair #magentahair #vacaville #vacaville hairstylist #sacramento #sanfrancisco #la #losangeles #lahair #hairstylist #vivid #haircolor #pretty #prettyhair #bold #raw #sultry #bayareahairstylist #newyork #nyhair #hairstyle #walnutcreek #napa #cordelia #haircolorist #hairinspo #hairoftheday #hairofinstagram @schwarzkopfpro @bloom.hairstudio @dg_beautydesign
