SHORT HAIR DON'T CARE • Nothing says spring like a fresh new #haircut, but sometimes the change in weather calls for more #extreme measures. Yesterday #ZoeKravitz, who most recently co-starred in the #HBO mini-series #BigLittleLies, unveiled a brand-new buzz cut courtesy of hairstylists #NikkiElms and #DanielMoon on #Instagram. The actress and musician teased her new look yesterday with a #photo of a pile of blonde hair on the floor of a salon, captioning it, “Oh sh*t: part 1.” A few hours later, she posted a striking selfie of her platinum-blonde buzz cut, captioned “Oh sh*t: part 2.” Maybe she and #KristenStewart can start a #punk band. • @zoeisabellakravitz  #kravitz #venice #california #platinum #lolawolf #music #blacksnobiety
