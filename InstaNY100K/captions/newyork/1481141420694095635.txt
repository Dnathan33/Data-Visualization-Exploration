Good morning/midday folks ☺ Time runs so fast: it's already our last full day in NYC! If the weather is okay, we'll try to go up the WTC Observatory (fingers crossed the ticket line isn't too deterringly long). To be honest before the trip, I was a bit worried, it might get "boring" since I've already been to New York before twice and have seen & done most of the touristy stuff...but no complaints whatsoever: we still saw/did so many new things, especially because we decided to check out some of the other boroughs like Brooklyn ☺ Yesterday we went to watch 'Beauty and the Beast' as it was pouring rain all day! I'm so glad I got the chance to watch the original version instead of the German translation, and the movie itself was amazing 😍 I loved how they adopted the songs from the Disney movie 1:1,, as well as the new songs! And of course, Emma Watson was perfect 👌🏻😅 Also, I'm a fan of the bougie movie theatres here! I mean: leather seats, electrically adjustable, foot rest, lots of space👌🏻 Finally (in case some of you are actually still reading and put up with my text of rusty English): I guess I'll refrain from taking a photo of the pile of accumulated paper and plastic bags I'm facing right now, next to my bed...because even seeing the shopping outcome of the last 6 days makes me realize, I did some serious damage 🙈Oups! I guess, a online shopping ban for a couple of months wouldn't hurt... And: I'm really glad I bought my gorgeous MCM Milla before heading to NYC! Otherwise, my bad conscience of having spent quite a lot in New York already might have stopped me from buying a luxury handbag on top of that... Broke but happy, I'd say 😅 But, I scored some really great bargains! Also, you never know when I'll come back to NY, so I might as well make the most of it :) #travelblog #manhattan #outfit #stroll #centralpark #ootd #birthdaytrip #bigapple #newyork #collectmemoriesnotthings #shopping #nycshopping #cinema #beautyandthebeast #sightseeing #mostbeautifulcity #nyc #happygirl #travellingram #goodmorningworld #goodmorning #happygirl #nyc #vacation #timessquare #travelling #birthdayvacation #blonde #glücklich #gutenmorgen #belvederecastle
