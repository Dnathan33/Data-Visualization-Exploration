Tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam is the finest building in Multan, built almost 800 years ago, with red brick, bounded with beams of shisham wood. At the time of its construction it was the largest building of Mausoleum until ‘Gol Gumbad’ i.e. the mausoleum of Sultan Adil Shah was built in Bijapur, India in 17th century Ad. Reportedly it was got built by a Tughlaq King of India, Sultan Ghiasuddin Tughlaq during the years 1320-1324 AD for himself. He died in 1325 in an accident in Delhi where he had built a new city called Tughlaqabad where another tomb was got built by him where he was buried. So the whole story is confusing. It appears that the king got the building of mausoleum started in Multan for himself. Later he revised his plans and got another mausoleum built in Tughlaqabad area of Delhi. On his sudden death in 1325, he was succeeded by his son Mohammad bin Tughlaq who later got this tomb at Multan completed and presented it for burial of his patron saint Shah Rukn-e-Alam when the later died in 1335 AD at the age of 84 years. (It is interesting to note that Mohammad bin Tughlaq was born in Kotla Tolay Khan, an ancient mohallah of Multan. Perhaps he might have thought for his own burial in Multan. He died in Thatha in 1351 and was buried in Delhi). Anyhow, the building of the tomb is the most imposing and largest in Pakistan. It is octagonal. The total height of the building from ground level is 100 feet. Hundreds of people come to pay homage to the saint daily from far and wide of Pakistan.  #ZK #ZohaibKhan #blessings #of #God #blessed #Look #Lookbook #singer #artist #model #blogger #followme #jb #justinbieber #zaynmalik #zayn #kyliejenner #kendalljenner #kimkardashian #ladygaga #eminem #london #paris #newyork #hollywood #fashion #style #love ☻
