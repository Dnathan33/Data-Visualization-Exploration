TGIF everyone! Starting today we will be sharing with you some of the raffle and silent auction prizes that we will have on April 29th to help our fundraising efforts for @sloankettering . Whether you're playing in our tournament or coming to spend the day with us, you'll have a chance to bid on this signed helmet from @obj . Maybe if @obj is around, he'll swing by #Roxbury High School and throw down some dunks! #NYG #silentauction #morriscountynj #newyork #NewJersey #fcancer #fundraise #charityevent
