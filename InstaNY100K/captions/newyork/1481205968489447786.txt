@rescuemevt soft, handmade tug toys are just what a puppy wants to sink their teeth into during some chew / play time.  Young puppies enjoy softer things to chew that they can feel satisfied they are "killing" with their puppy chompers.  This is why puppies tend to gravitate toward anything with "give" that comes into reach (hands, feet, pants legs, shoes, wires, carpet, blankets, door trim, etc.). Anything that feels "GOOD" to chew and is at puppy eye level!  Items that are too hard can also pose a risk to chip or injure baby teeth.  Be sure to carefully select items for your young puppy to chew to satisfy them, but offer safe chewing!  AND of course "puppy proof" by picking up as much as possible and not allowing your puppy to roam  free and find something inappropriate or dangerous to chew on.  Jasper approves of these wonderful soft and chewy tugs ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’–! You can order one for your dog or puppy from Rescue Me VT!  #balancedlifek9training
