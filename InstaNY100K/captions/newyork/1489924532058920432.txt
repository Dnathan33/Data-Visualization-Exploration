"In the 1980s, painting recaptured the imagination of the contemporary art world against a backdrop of expansive change. An unprecedented number of galleries appeared on the scene, particularly in downtown New York."⠀ ⠀ "Many addressed fundamental questions about artmaking in their work, while others took on political issues including AIDS, feminism, gentrification, and war. In the face of a media-saturated environment, artists in the 1980s recommitted to painting. Far from dead, painting came to represent an important intersection between new ways of seeing and a seemingly traditional way of making art."⠀ ⠀ --⠀ ⠀ #whitney #whitneymuseum #museum #art #1980s #newyork #nyc #manhattan #chelsea #meatpackingdistrict⠀ ⠀
