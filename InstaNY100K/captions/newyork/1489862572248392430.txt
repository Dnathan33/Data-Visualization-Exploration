This elderly lady inspired me and showed me a cool trick on how to take pictures when all reflects are gone.  As she waited (on her 3rd attempt), the animals waited for her to turn.  She stood there holding her flip phone, holding steady and waited.  The squirrels, bluejays, and the small gang of birds were coming close to nut she left wood... none came.  She then gave up and kept it and said "o what the heck" lol.. This strategy she used is something ill try eventually lol
