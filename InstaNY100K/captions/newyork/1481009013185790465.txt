I just read a post on my facebook of a girl hating on her parents, here is somthing i wanna say. When i was 12 or 13 n i had to breakup with my then boyfriend and move to agra i was also there and was hating on my parents but back then i didnt know that i am their only surviving child who was premature and had to be taken to hospitals at 3.am in a small town like ara (they lost two of my brothers before me). I never knew that when i was having my upper gum and jaw correction  surgury..my dad didnt care about paying those bucks ,he was worried about my being well after the surgury.  I remember the day i took admission in resonance  my dad paid  1 lakh 50 thousands in cash at once..not cause we have alot of money but cause he wanted me to face no such problems as he did...! I remem my dad gifting me this phone without telling me and giving me faith everytime when  i said that i cant be a supermodel . My mother always tells me that super tall and my dad is always ready to be by my side. But i didnt know all this back then,i am not saying that dont say things or dont express your anger but i am just saying tryn to know the whole story ..express your anger but before you do remember  they will never want you to go through  what they have been through and yes,today i can say that was my  best decision. .. ðŸ˜Š . . #houston #sanfrancisco #bikinimodels #agencymodel #newyork #madrid #losangelesfashion #beverlyhills #gold45revolver #fineartphotography #fitnessmodels #california #follow4follow #zombie #losangeles #fashionmodels #chicago #laphorographer #dallas #florida #connecticut #dtla #miami #fitness #lamodel #like4like #michigan #ïº°ï»£ïº®ï»˜ïº·ïº®ï»“ #boy #WLYG
