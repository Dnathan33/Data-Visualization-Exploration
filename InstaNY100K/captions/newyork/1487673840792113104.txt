Jet lagged and thirsty we had a tip from a local to check out Mcsorley's Old Ale House. They only serve two drinks - light or dark beer - and when you order a beer you're given two! That's our kind of bar üçª definitely worth a visit, for the historical factor alone #mcsorleysoldalehouse #newyorkdrinks #newyork #beer #lager
