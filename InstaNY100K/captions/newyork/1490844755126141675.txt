Big and strong shoulders!  Work on them properly with a total control! Don't swing weights with a rhythm! It's not dancing!  Keep the tension all the time and slowly implement it!  For fashion, nicely developed shoulders are beautiful! For fighting, strong shoulders keep your hands up longer! Once they come down, "Bang" you are finished!  Don't blame on genetics! It's how you do it!  Www.KenYasuda.com.
