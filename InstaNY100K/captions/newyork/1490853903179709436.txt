On the left: April 11, 2015 . On the right: April 11, 2017 . I can't believe how much my bookcase has grown in the past two years.

Nevertheless, my collection continues to grow and expand, and with it, my repertoire of creative storage solutions.  I've got mugs, postcards, book-themed matches, and even a bottle of wine (thanks, @violeta_suns) up there for decoration. . My shelves are a hot mess (just like my life).
