"Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping. For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts. And stand together, yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow." â€”Kahlil Gibran #BayviewFlorist #QOTD #Love #FreshFlowers #FlowersOfTheDay #Flowerstagram #Arrangement #Spring #Massapequa #MassapequaPark #Plainedge #LongIsland #ShopLocal #ShopSmall #NewYork
