After a heated, dramatic victory last night, the Mets are back in action Tuesday, as they go for the series win against the Phillies with Matt Harvey on the mound for his second start of the season.  Last time out, Matt Harvey looked like a revitalized pitcher. Slimmed down and throwing in the upper-90s, Harvey’s start against the Braves looked like the Harvey from 2015 or 2013. In 6 2/3 innings that night, Harvey struck out four, walked none, scattered three hits and surrendered just two runs, both via solo homers. In his career, the Dark Knight is the owner of a 2.66 ERA and 6-2 record in nine starts against the Phillies. Harvey’s last start against the Phillies came a exactly a year ago to yesterday, when he received the loss on April 10, 2016. Harvey is looking to go 2-0 to start a season for the first time since 2015, and a win would be the first time he’s strung together consecutive wins since April 22 and 27 last season.  Facing the Mets tonight will be Philadelphia righty Clay Buchholz, who was traded from the Red Sox this winter. Buchholz has never faced the Mets in his 11-year MLB career. Buchholz is making his second start as a Philly, and his first one didn’t go as planned. Against the Reds on April 6, the veteran allowed four earned runs in five innings of work, giving up eight hits and walking two in a no-decision.  Will Matt Harvey be able to build off his strong start last time out? How do you think Clay Buchholz will fare in his first ever start against the Mets?  The answers can be seen at 7:10, when first pitch Tuesday is thrown. The game can be seen on SNY and heard on WOR. LGM!  #Mets #Phillies #NewYork #Philadelphia #baseball #sports #NYC #CitiField #LGM
