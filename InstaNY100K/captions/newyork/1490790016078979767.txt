The personality of the Month is Caro!  Caro is one of our tenants, she's an artist who moved to Brooklyn a few years ago and has fallen in love with the city. She’s originally from Lima, Peru and loves to paint, travel, and nature. She recently moved into one of our new buildings and has agreed to answer a few questions.  How did you find the apartment and why did you pick this apartment?  I was looking for a duplex, where I could have my studio and my apartment under the same roof, originally, I found another apartment in Bushwick but they didn’t allow cats. So, when my broker contacted me and showed me this apartment I loved it straight away.  Your apartment is located in Bed-Stuy, what is it that you like the most about the neighborhood?  I like how calm the neighborhood is, it’s way cheaper than many other places in Brooklyn and the public transportation in the area suits my needs. Also, as an artist, I really appreciate all the beautiful art that you can see walking down any street, the graffiti and art studios. If you compare Brooklyn with Manhattan, people are more willing to interact with their neighbors and to make things happen in the local community.  What’s your favorite place in Brooklyn?  That’s a good question, I would say either Rockaway or Bushwick, I know that they are very different but that's what I love the most about Brooklyn, how diverse it can be. I’m originally from Lima, Peru, which is a city by the water so I really enjoy the contrast between the water and the city.  Thank you, Caro, for taking you time and we wish you good luck!
