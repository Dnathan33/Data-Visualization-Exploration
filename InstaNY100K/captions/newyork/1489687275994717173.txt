This picture reflects perfectly what the Vancouver Real Estate Market is like. Today I went to 3 open houses with investors clients and each and everyone of them looked like ants nests with multiple offers everywhere. On the bright side I got 2 new listings coming this week. I hope everyone has an amazing, successful, and productive week👍👍🏡🏡💪👊
