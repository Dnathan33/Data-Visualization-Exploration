#swiperight ▶️ When you work for yourself, you can take a 1/2 day to have lunch in Hoboken with a college friend you haven't seen in seven years! So great catching up with Spencer. It was an adventure for me traveling by train, making transfers all by myself. Slowly but surely I'm getting better at public transportation. The views from Hoboken looking over the Hudson River to see the NYC skyline was breathtaking. 80 degree weather helps too!
