I have talked to a lot of people about my trip to New York City with @kalibrocklehurst. 1 thing that always seemed to come up was that I didn't share enough of it. At the time I didn't want to spam my account with it, especially with all the exciting things happening directly after. Now months later, I find myself reflecting time and time again on how impactful this trip was. Everything from riding the subway to seeing @jonbellion in concert. So with all that being said I decided I am going to share 9 more photos of my time spent in NYC. Starting with this shot of DUMBO. DUMBO was one of those bucket list shots I just wanted to get, and this one was the first time I seen with my own eyes how nicely the Manhattan Bridge fits between the buildings.
