How essential is protein? Let's put it this way: Protein is the body's powerhouse. It is a critical part of our daily diet because every single cell in the body needs it to function. Protein is one of the most important building blocks for muscles, bones, blood, skin, tissue + cartilage. It also provides neurological support, balances hormones, aids in digestion, produces enzymes + provides energy. As a vegetarian, protein intake NEEDS to be a focus + my main staple are eggs. Why? They each contain around 6gms of protein as well as good fatty acids, B vitamins (including B12), Selenium, Folate + high levels of HDL cholesterol - the GOOD type of cholesterol which is linked to reduced risk of several diseases + health issues. A recent study suggested that by consuming 2 eggs per day for 6 weeks, you increase HDL cholesterol by 10% - if you are short for time consider boiling a big batch at the beginning of the week + having them in your fridge for when you need them! ðŸ“·@whatannieseating
