My last night in NYC at a roof top bar in the upper east side of Manhattan! These past 4 days have been phenomenal-- spent quality time with a close childhood friend, biked 25 miles to and from Jersey, wandered around lower and upper Manhattan on my own, ate poke, Pret, and 99 cent slice pizzas everyday (I am obsessed with poke now), drank iced coffee 3 times a day... #NYC, I've visited you before, but I'm falling more and more in love with you. Until next time ✌️#newyork #newyorkcity #rooftopbar #manhattan #eastcoast #usa #estadosunidos #nuevayork #amigas #citylife #traveler #salvationtaco #tallfriends #thecitythatneversleeps #solotraveler #wanderlust #thebigapple
