@mysha101 this was a #tribute to #TheYellowRoseOfTexas and her story. She was a #servant ðŸ˜’ to Col. Morgan, he settled #MorgansPoint here in #SouthEastTexas and so she got a #historicalmarker telling her story at his #gravesite. She was a free #mulatto woman, but she lost her #papers "After the war". It also said that she and the wife of #DeZavala escaped to #NewYork and she was never heard of again.  Hell, i wouldnt have come back either with no papers! Ha! But i thought it was neat to see her story. âœŒâœŠ #SheWasProllyDope #HERstory #History #Texas #BattleofSanJacinto  #TexasHistory #TexasEducation
