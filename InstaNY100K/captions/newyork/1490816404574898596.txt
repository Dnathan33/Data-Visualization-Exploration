The Greenwich Savings Bank was a savings bank based in New York City that operated from 1833 to 1981. At the time of its closure in 1981, it was the 16th largest bank in the U.S. by total deposits. In  its final three days the bank lost $500 million in deposits out of its total of $1.5 billion due to a run on the bank. Haier America purchased the building in 2000 to be its American corporate headquarters. In 2002, Haier rechristened it The Haier Building.  All the facts aside I think it looks really pretty at night with the lights shining on it.  #aoiferosetravel #gettinglostwithme #traveling #newyorkcity
