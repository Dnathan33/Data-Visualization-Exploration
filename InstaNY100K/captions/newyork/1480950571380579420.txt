Early into the sunny days of the spring season, this cottage located amidst the meandering ocean waters of the Stony Brook Beach is a hidden jewel in Long Island.  Route: 15 mins cycling from the Stony Brook LIRR train station towards the north shore.  Cost: Absolutely free and rarely populated.  Extras: Best time to visit is during low tide where one can walk along the beach waters to locate this spot.  #sbu #stonybrookuniversity #stonybrook #stonybrookvillage #stonybrookbeach #stonybrookharbor #longisland #lirr #longislandlife #newyork #newyorker #newyorklife #newyorkers #lonelyplanet #nature #cottage #beach #beachlife #atlantic #ocean #oceanbeach #travel #travelgram #travelphotography #traveling #solo #solotravel
