I can definitely see these framed on a white wall at the Moma, celebrated as early Cy Twomblys would be. It's so important not to limit your eyes to context. Most would dismiss these as rusted metal and mere vandalism when they carry an elegance some work their whole life on achieving in their art. Beauty is not confined to the walls of galleries nor to established names. #graffiti #tags #art #artlovers #urbanart #vandalism #handstyle #texture #textures #newyorkgraffiti #newyork #newyorkcity #nyc #bronx #artiseveywhere #wallpoetry #moma #artoutside #accidentalart #urbanaesthetics #urbanhieroglyphics
