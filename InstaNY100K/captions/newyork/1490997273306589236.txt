From this weekend:  My top 3 favorite places in New York State! I love that I have no cell connection here. There are no outlets. You have to build a fire if you want hot food or heat.. The roads for cycling are challenging, exciting, and rewarding. Fishing, boating, hiking, camping, and whatever legal activity you desire are yours..... But that wind off those lakes while I was cycling reached my soul and my bones.... ðŸ˜¥  #sevenlakes #kanawauke  #trek #silque #roadbike #almostspring #cyclingforcancer #ESR2017 #empirestateride #newyork #cyclingchick #fitnesschick
