"When we say goodbye, it's not just to our new friends, but the person we've become. But, like I tell myself whenever I leave a place, I can come back whenever I want. And maybe that's the beautiful part of this whole experience - you see things most don't by coming & going. Maybe this is how to live. Take the extremes with grace. When you feel a heavy chest in a moment that's soon to end, keep in turning (and loving) each chapter. You've got to find out how the story ends." ~ travel friendships story up now.
