People need to be encouraged. People need to be reminded of how wonderful they are. People need to be believed in â€” told that they are brave and smart and capable of accomplishing all the dreams they dream and more. Remind each other of this.  Wonderful to have my inspiring friend Tanzila Khan @optimismexpert  in New York, last week. Who was here to participate in Commission on Population and Development at United Nations. #friends #newyorkcity #Quote #newyork #roonjhainus #tanzilakhan
