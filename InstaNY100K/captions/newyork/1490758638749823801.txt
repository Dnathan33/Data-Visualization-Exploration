NY is a large size coffee on the go, an old church next to a skyscraper and Monica's apartment on Bedford Street. It's a crowded and kinda dirty subway station, jazz music playing on the corner of the street and a scary walk home at night.  They say NY is a state of mind, but you have no idea till you get there. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ #newyork #nyc #brooklyn #brooklynbridge #bigapple #usa
