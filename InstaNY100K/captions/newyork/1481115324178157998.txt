Good morning! It is such a wonderful thing to have fellowship with God. Remember, Jesus is the Light and He doesn't fellowship with darkness. Let us not put ourselves in the position to be separated from Him. This is what happens when we purpose to sin. Why chose to sin when He has washed all of our sins away? Let's choose righteousness and walk in the light today and always. Have a wonderful day.#god #jesus #bible #homeless #christianity #christians #pray #lord #christ #salvation #praise #worship #motivationalquotes #saved #jesuschrist #london #newyork #holyspirit #jehova #bless #memes #sunday #somebody #churchmemes #memehistory #life #love #my #yes #blessed
