Hey everyone! I am so happy to announce  that I am officially back to doing what I love, tattooing. I am with a great team of tattoo artists at Asylum Tattoo in Copiague. If anyone is interested in a tattoo please private message me and we can come up with a design, discuss any questions you may have and set up a time for you to come down to the shop. Thank you for all the support and for your patience. #asylumtattoo #copiague #newyork #brittanydeetattoos #art #artist #career #tattoo #coilmachines #shader #liner #tattoos #femaletattooartist #passion #tattooartist #tattooapprentice  #tattooportfolio #tattoofamily #longislandartist #longislandtattooartist #nyartist #longislandtattooshop #tattooapprenticeship  #asylum #tattoo #goals #tattoodesigns #asylumtat2 #brittanydeeart @asylumtat2l
