A little late with this post but one of the best things I've done since being in New York is seeing the new musical 'Sunday in the Park with George' - incredible cast, a moving story and very original in one of the most grand and beautiful spaces. A fabulous and wonderful evening - can I do it all again? P.S. This photo is of one of my favourite parts - waiting for the magic to begin! #anticipation ðŸ˜Š #newyork #newyorknewyork #broadway #thehudson #hudsontheatre #sundayintheparkwithgeorge #iwanttostayhere #musical #jakegyllenhaal #annaleighashford #amazing #canidoitallagain
