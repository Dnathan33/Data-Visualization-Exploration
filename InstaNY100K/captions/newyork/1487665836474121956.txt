Meet me at the station...what a stunner! The boards always show the train times a little fast so passengers don't have to make a mad dash for the train. Or you can see what time it is in the $10 million clock. Commute in style! ❤🇺🇸 #architecture #grandcentralstation #nyc #newyorkcity #newyork #42ndstreet #lexingtonavenue #beautiful #zodiac #commuters #nycstyle #wanderlust #husbandsbigbirthday #traveltheworldwithme #travelbuddy #travel #love #turquoise #light #mustseelist
