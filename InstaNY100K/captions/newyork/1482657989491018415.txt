:Insert NY Accent: "Yo! Are we in Europe, somewheh?" "Get outta here! We're in Cold Spring, New Yawk!" 😉 Loved the sight of this white Fiat parked in front of the charming architecture and colors in Cold Spring. Since it's such a gray, rainy day, hadda make it black 'n white...but with a lil' splash of Spring green. 💚😁💚 Happy Friday, everybody! 🎉 . . . #Spring #EuropeanFeels #ColdSpring #ColdSpringNY #PutnamCounty #HudsonValley  #HudsonValleyLife #HudsonValleyNY #HudsonValleyNewYork #DownstateNY #NY #NewYork #ILoveNY #ILoveNewYork #Europe #Fiat #CarsOfInstagram #BlackAndWhite #BlackAndWhitePhoto #BlackAndWhitePhotography #Charm #ColorSplash #HVCompass #VisitVortex #IG_HudsonValley #IG_NewYork #BAW #BNW #NYCToBeacon #BeaconTransplant
