You may or may not know that I'm a HUGE fan of the TV show "Veep". As in, it is my all-time favorite show. Today I got to meet @reidscott_ who plays "Dan" on the show & got to hear him speak about the upcoming season. The Sunday night premiere of Season 6 can't get here soon enough!!! ðŸ˜¬ P.S. He was nothing like "Dan" in real life, which is to say he seemed like a very kind and gracious person. #veep #aolbuild #aolbuildseries #reidscott #danegan #favoritetvshow #happymonday #veepseason6 #nicecelebrity #newyork #nyc #newyorkcity #manhattan @veephbo
