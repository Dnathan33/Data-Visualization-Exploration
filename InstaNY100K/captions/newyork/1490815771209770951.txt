Aloe vera contains something called proteolytic enzymes which repairs dead skin cells on the scalp. It also acts as a great conditioner and leaves your hair all smooth and shiny. It promotes hair growth, prevents itching on the scalp, reduces dandruff and conditions your hair. Diane Gage, author of  Aloe Vera: Nature's Soothing Healer says, "Keratin, the primary protein of hair, consists of amino acids, oxygen, carbon, and small amounts of hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulphur. Aloe vera has a chemical make up similar to that of keratin and it rejuvenates the hair with its own nutrients, giving it more elasticity and preventing breakage." #HairTipTuesday #healthyhair #ScalpTreatment #scalpFacial #Treatment #follicals #beautifulhairbylarissa #BHbL #pgh #pittsburgh #la #losangeles #newyork #nyc #miami #atl #atlanta #larissaLane
