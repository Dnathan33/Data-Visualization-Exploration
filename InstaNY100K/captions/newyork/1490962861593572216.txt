Thank you New York, you were the most incredible experience of my life. Both in the vastness, energy, people of the city, and in the fast-paced, procedural diversity in the ER with the most wonderful doctors I had ever met, I'm completely awestruck. 🏙️ #adventure #newyork #timesquare #instagood #picoftheday
