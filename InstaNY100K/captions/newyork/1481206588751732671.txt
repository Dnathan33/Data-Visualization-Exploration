||This morning I woke up  Alongside the sun,  To birds singing  Outside my window- And in that moment I thought to myself, "Why can't I wake up like that, too?" And the birds, they reminded me That your flight  And your song, Is all in the choice, After you wake up. || • • • • ~ all in the choice ~ a.g. #original
