| L I F E  L E S S O N S| I wasn't a sporty girl growing up.  I am zero'd out at coordination and the desire to be all sweaty and running around some type of field is non existent. I was usually in my room drawing or painting. My parents put me in an art class a woman in my area gave. She made such a huge impact on me. She taught me to paint and draw but more importantly she would teach me about the painters I was painting from. I was very drawn to Van Gogh and spent a large portion of my time painting his paintings and learning about him from my teacher! Even now, 15 years later I'm still learning about Van Gogh and falling in love with his legacy. So today, may everything you do be done in love. Happy Wednesday! . . . #paintings #fineart #stilllife #nature #girl #travel #landscape #inspiration #lifestyle #newyork #nyc #vangogh #arteducation #artistic #artwork #popart #style #creativity #vincentvangogh #impressionism #postmodernart #starrystarrynight #inspirationalquotes #love #goldpolkadots #loveoneanother #donewell #lovewins #inspo #maketodaygreat
