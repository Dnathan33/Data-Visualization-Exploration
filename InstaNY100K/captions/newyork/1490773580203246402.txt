It was the summer of 1997, the first n last summer, when we went to a far away small town, for a vacation in that ancient, beautiful cottage.. The walls were made of mud and stone. On the exterior, in some places, mud plaster was coming off in some kind of a pattern, with green patches of algae, it almost looked like a painting.. I remember how I used to draw on those patches using sharp pebbles.. the smell of cow dung, the noise of trains on nearby railway track, painted portraits in the corridor.. a strange smell of a perfume always surrounded rooms..vanishing but always present. . In the afternoons, me and some kids  would eat mangoes shade of a huge banyan tree adjacent the house.. One afternoon, my mother n granny had gone to visit a relative, so they told me not to go outside.. In boredom, I decided to explore inside.. when I found her. Rosavella was like a magnet to me.. oh the perfume made me dizzy. She said she was waiting for me since a long time.. That she watches me play under the tree, everyday from the small ventilator.. and hears me cry when mother scolds me for not sleeping.. . She said she loves the sound of me weeping.. Giggling, she told me how she pushed me from the staircase when I had not cried since 2 days! I punched her in the face! "How nasty of you" I said. She continued laughing until the sound of my mother's footsteps were heard. . I told my mom about her. So she threw her out of the house, in a big garbage ground, away from the town's narrow lanes. I had never seen her since then.. soon the fragrance also vanished.. . Today my daughter was crying continuously since she fell from the old swing of the banayan tree and told me her friend 'Rosavella' pushed her.. I was showing the cottage to a prospective buyer, when I saw Rosavella, at the exact same place.. I regret not stopping the buyer's kid to take her with them.. They also liked how the house smelled.. so I guess its a deal then! ;) . . . . . . . . . . . .  #horror#story#doll#instagood#instagram#likes#photography#wordporn#writing#writersofinstagram#stories#india#loveindia#_soi#newyork#mumbai#paris#sydney#instamood#iphone#vsco#vscocam#trvel#travelgram#art
