@newyorkerdiner gets an Xrayted score of 7/10 The restaurant is perfectly themed as an American diner, as soon as you walk in you are greeted by lovely staff who take you to your table.  Once seated you choose what you want to eat by a simple menu, the restaurant does not offer table service which was a downer so you have to place your order over the counter. Seating is nice and comfortable except the smell from the toilet  Food is well presented and looks amazing as you can see from the pictures. Chicken well cooked but pieces could have been a bit smaller. Overall the food was well cooked and had very nice flavours.  At Xrayted we give @newyorkerdiner a thumbs up 👍🏻 #food #diner #burgers #hotdogs #desserts #milkshakes #newyork #manchester #city #chinatown #meatbox
