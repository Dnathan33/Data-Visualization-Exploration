Tonkatsu Matsunoya Restaurant: Pork Katsu Udon. Pork was extremely tender inside. Broth had good flavor but lacking some spice....adding the red chili powder did the trick. They give too little broth so make sure to ask for extra. Overall great choice! From 3-5 food and beer at a discount. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ (out of 5 ❤️) for #food. 👠👠👠 (out of 5 👠) for #presentation. 💎💎💎 (out of 5 💎) for #service. 👑👑👑 (out of 5 👑) for #decor. #foodistasny #foodie #foodgram #foodpics #foodporn #instafood #healthyeating #healthychoices #healtylifestyle #instagood #foodblogger #foodlover #foodgasm #pork #katsu #udon #soup #delicious #lunch #authentic #Japanese #cuisine #midtown #newyorkcity #newyork
