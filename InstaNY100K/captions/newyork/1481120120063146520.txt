Every human being, created in the image of God, is endowed with a power akin to that of the Creator—individuality, POWER TO THINK AND TO DO. The men in whom this power is developed are the men who bear responsibilities, who are leaders in enterprise, and who influence character. It is the work of true education to develop this power, to train the youth to be thinkers, and not mere reflectors of other men’s thought. ED 17.2  Pray this morning that we may be like Jesus and be a thinker and a doer after His pattern.  #getupanddo #work #work #work #2017 #life #newyork #missions #youthpioneers
