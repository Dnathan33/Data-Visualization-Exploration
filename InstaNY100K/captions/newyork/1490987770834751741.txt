Some junior improvements this week @sea_island GPC. Getting the chest to rotate back and up with higher hand plane can help create the proper pivot in the backswing.  Larger hand plane can also help add clubhead speed. Notice the change in hand plane shape in the backswing. #goodtobeyoung #juniorgolf
