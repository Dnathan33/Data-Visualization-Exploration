Head over to www.idobi.com to read our Day In The Life piece--courtesy of @thatgrlaudrey !  Among many other things, I had a chance to talk about what it's like being Type 1 Diabetic on the road in the article. Although I make a lot of jokes about my disease, diabetes really is no joke. If I don't pay close attention to it, I have a hard time sleeping, eating, waking up, running drumming, and even thinking clearly. . . . . . #storiesuntold #cantgohome #idobi #dayinthelife #tour #newyork #longisland
