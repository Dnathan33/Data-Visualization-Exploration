I have a five day weekend ahead of me before catching a flight to vegas for the remainder of the month. I wish my husband shared the same schedule as me but I suppose that's a luxury not many can afford.. making weekends all the more precious! What do y'all have on your agendas for this hopefully beautiful weekend? Even doing nothing sounds so lovely, mental health days are a must..! Equal parts pizza, netflix, crafts + naps.
