I've been learning #Taichi past 20 years & never got it right. Now with highly knowledgeable and articulate  sensei #mitchellDavis  #taichi master extraordinaire from #newyork & co-chairperson of #worlds50best  I'm understanding the soft flowing balancing movements of this ancient #chinese #martialart .Learning  #Taoist #Taichi  for balance and tranquility  im  Learning to let go and to be in the moment. I love the old Chinese saying "whoever practices Tai Chi regularly will in time gain the suppleness of a child,  the strength of a lion, and the peace of mind of a sage.' Old Chinese Saying.
