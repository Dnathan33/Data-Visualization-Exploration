Ticked another thing off my musical to-so list: see a concert at #carnegiehall. We went to the Gotham Sings concert, which featured the Oslo Chamber Choir (cond. HÃ¥kon Daniel Nysted). Their performance was near other-worldly, and their voices are exquisite. It was one of those times where I realised that I was so immersed in the music that after they finished, I had absolutely no idea of how much time had passed since they began singing.  Their set of traditional Norwegian folk songs has made it up there with my favourite concert experiences ever. #music #concerthall #choir #beautiful #choirmusic #oslochamberchoir #chamberchoir #newyork #lifeofacomposer #nyc #nycðŸ—½
