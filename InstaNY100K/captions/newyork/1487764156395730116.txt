Meet Arnie, our stunning 2 year old Lab mix boy who found himself at a high kill Texas shelter as a stray!  Arnie is 50lbs, friendly, and perfect in every way. He still needs a medical workup, we are hoping all he needs is a neuter and UTD vaccinations. We anticipate having Arnie in NY next weekend!
