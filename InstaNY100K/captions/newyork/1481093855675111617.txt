What have you done lately that was just straight off the cuff - totally outside the square and completely left field from anything you'd generally be inclined to do?  The act of being spontaneous and spicing life up to shift focus and attention from the norm to the unknown, creating aspects of FUN, EXCITEMENT, ADVENTURE, and MOTIVATION!  I can't help but to shake my head listening to couples ask back and forward what one or the other wants to do because nobody seems to be able to make a decision! When did you last make a call and plan something totally random, take control and ownership that leads to inspiration and change!  Christmas Day we'd normally spend fighting over a bowl of prawns with family, though this time we decided we'd sit court side at Madison Square Garden NY to watch the Knicks game...... Get my point ;) #health #instafit #strong #fitness #fitspo #photooftheday #instahealth #active #motivation #inspiration #instagood #universe #grateful #energy #spiritual #meditation #coach #mindset #focus #yoga #newyork #knicks #christmas #travel
