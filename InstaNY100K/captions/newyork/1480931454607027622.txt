Salvador #Dalí was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His best-known work, The #PersistenceofMemory, was completed in August 1931. Dalí employed extensive symbolism in his work. For instance, "melting watches" that first appear in The Persistence of Memory suggest Einstein's theory that time is relative and not fixed. . #luxury #lifestyle #pinkysup #artist #fineart #surrealism #artandwellington #ny #newyork #la #losangeles #chicago #sanfrancisco #artscene #fashion #photooftheday #instaart #creative #color #love #follow #instalike #instaart #artagram #artgallery
