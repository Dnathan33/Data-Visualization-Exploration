A #promise: "to #assure #someone that one will definitely do, give, or arrange something; undertake or declare that something will #happen." I take promises #seriously because,  you've got to really care about someone to tell them that you will do everything to make something happen. You've got to be human enough to make a promise understanding, that you have no way of knowing what might happen next that may prevent you from keeping that promise.  You've got to have faith in someone to believe them when they make promises.  Both parties have to truly be honest when we acknowledge that we're surrounded by stories of forced and broken promises....that you see something in them that assures one that the other will try everything they can.  Maybe it's the way you feel around this person. Maybe it's the look in their eyes. Maybe it's because this person is someone that makes you remember how much love you have left in your heart.  Maybe it's because you both acknowledge how fleeting life is, and how much you realize how important a #friend really becomes as you grow older... So if you make a promise to me, #mean it.
