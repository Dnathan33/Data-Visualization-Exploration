#CIRCUSALERT! 🎪🤸🏻‍♀️ "Cuisine & Confessions" by @the7fingers. - So. I just watched the unbelievably amazing, most brilliant, creative genius of a #circus show ever. EVER‼️ The concept of Circus x Culinary Arts served the audience with fun, never-before-seen #acrobatics, #pole, & #silks acts with incredible drops, tricks & spins unlike any other PLUS actual cooking of pasta 🍝 and baking of banana bread 🍰- which, btw, the audience got to eat at the end of the show. ✌🏼 I was starving so it was even more convenient aaand it was delicious. 🤤 Cooking while performing circus? Impressive. ✨ I have absolutely no words for this truly one-of-a-kind show. Just PHENOMENAL. And it was so funny and engaging too with a ton of audience interaction!! Please watch if you haven't already and you'll see what I'm talking about. Ughh. 😍 - 📸🚫 Didn't record any except the ones posted here cuz photo/video taking wasn't allowed. Also I stole photos from the Internet heheh. - #cuisineandconfessions #the7fingers #contemporarycircus #nyuskirball #manhattan #newyork #circuseverydamnday @nyuskirball
