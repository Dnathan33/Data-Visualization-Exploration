Think Spring!  We love this shot of one of our projects in Saratoga Springs.  A sunny day, beautiful blue skies, flowers blooming, and of course, solar panels hard at work!  This sustainably designed home is is certified LEED Platinum by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC) and “Emerald” rated by the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB). #Houzz  #dwellmagazine #SaratogaCountyChamber #ExploreSaratoga  #NewYork  #capregionchamber  #modern.architect  #sustainable_architecture  #sustainablearchitecture  #thisplacematters  #saratogaliving  #residentialphotography  #residential_architecture  #healthylivingnewyork #usgbc #healthyhouse #nahb #leed
