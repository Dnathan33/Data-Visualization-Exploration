Daily Dose of Herc: the Herc report. Well i decided that if i block off Turkeys duct spot it will just upset him and to buy anything tall enough for his liking would be too expensive, so i was looking on amazon and they have skateboard grip tape that i can easily put on the metal ductwork so he can grip it and not fall. A few sheets should be good, its on top of his wishlist if anyone wants to get him some. He also LOVES cardboard scratchers as you can see in the pic he has destroyed both of his lol so now that i know what he likes i put a little bigger one on his wishlist too. They are cheap and he has fun with them so its a win win. I think he will be happiest if i let him keep his favorite spot so this is what i came up with, cant have turkey falling anymore tho 🦃 🐱👁👁💪 #hercules#stankeye #blackcat #herculesthecat#littlewanderersnyc #rescuecat#rescuecatsofinstagram #rescuecats #nyccat#whiskerwednesday #fosteringsaveslives#adoptdontshop #helpcats #catladyproblems#instacat #feralcat #crazycatlady #newyork#adoption #foster #pet #ilovemycat #love #cutekitty#savecats #picoftheday #catoftheday#catsofinstagram #adoptiontails#tuxedocatsofinstagram
