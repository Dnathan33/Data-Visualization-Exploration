Upon returning home from a tough work trip, I was elated to see a big box at my door (because I knew exactly what was inside)!! ...yes, I still get an Easter basket! I think I may actually look forward to it more than Christmas because my mother tends to go out of her way to find our favorite little things. And I think that's so much of the joy ...to feel so well known by someone. She herself has been so busy with a lot of stuff on a compressed timeline, but this year she really outdid herself!! From the Honey aged in Bourbon Barrels to my favorite treats of Marzipan and Haribo peaches ...to Duck Fat Caramels (yes, Duck Fat Caramels) and guide books on Nashville. And if that wasn't enough, she somehow managed to find Anzac Biscuits ...a treat I fell in love with in Australia! She even "pre-aged" my peeps. I FaceTimed her before I opened it so we could do it together ...and I'm so glad I did ...because this was her best Easter basket yet!! Thank you Momma!! This is over the top!!!! ðŸ’œ 101/365 #jessicathompson365 42/46 #jhtlent2017 #nyc #newyork #newyorkcity #knoxville #tennessee #easterbasket #eastertreats #family #treats #love #gifts #lovelanguages #time #photooftheday
