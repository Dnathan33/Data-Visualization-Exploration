"Midway in the journey of our life..." Join us over Easter weekend as our troupe of artists puts on an experimental musical performance of "The Divine Comedy." Come ride with us across the River Styx and up into Celestial Sphere.  WHAT: The Divine Comedy: A Musical Performance  WHEN:  Friday, April 14 @ 8 pm Saturday, April 15 @ 6 pm Sunday, April 16 @ 2 pm  WHERE: Cathedral Hall 380 Montgomery St Jersey City, NJ 07302  DM me for more info! . . . In this weekend of artistic delights, we will collaborate across disciplines to bring together visual artists, poets, actors, musicians, and chefs who will all contribute their unique take on the "The Divine Comedy," all within the awe-inspiring space of Cathedral Hall.  This 3-act performance -- Inferno, Purgatorio, Paradiso -- will use the gorgeous cathedral's many different physical spaces to engage with the audience as the story progresses into the deepest circles of despair and up again into true harmony. . . . #performance #newyork #theatre #music #poetry #art #foodie #brooklyn #jerseycity #newjersey #arts #performanceart #divinecomedy #inferno #purgatorio #paradiso #dante #community #friends #collaborate #poetsofinstagram #poets #bands #livemusic
