As one of the largest natural building stone providers in the Northeast, producing a high quality finished product has always been the most important factor of business for the owner of @champlain_stone and for the Phinney Design Group. The team utilized a diverse array of stone products including the use of custom and polished stone finishes using the companyâ€™s product line; the final product provided the new corporate image that Champlain Stone needed for their growing business.  #Adirondacklifemagazine #SaratogaCountyChamber #capregionchamber  #ExploreSaratoga  #new_york_state  #aianewyorkstate #modern.architect  #sustainable_architecture  #sustainablearchitecture  #thisplacematters  #NewYork  #stonemason #stonemasonry #champlain_stone #commercialdesign #officedesign #creativeworkspace
