"Whisper me sun,  that could bright our day,  and I would whisper you moon,  for you to seek its light under our darkest sky.  Whisper me rainbow,  the beautiful one that comes rarely after storm,  and I would whisper you stars,  to be the guidance whenever you feel lost.  Whisper me spring,  where flowers of different colours bloom to please the eyes,  and I would whisper you autumn,  to soothe the eyes the beauty of fallen leaves.  Whisper me winter, the beautiful white cotton balls that drop from the sky,  and I would whisper you summer, where crystal blue ocean matches the color of blue sky.  Whisper me love, the one that connects souls,  and I would whisper you, for you to be the love to my soul."
