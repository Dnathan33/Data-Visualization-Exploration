Bow Bridge is Central Park's first cast iron bridge, named for the way it arcs gracefully over the lake like a violin bow. It's such a romantic spot, and the views over the lake to the Upper West Side are always lovely. The only thing I didn't like about it this weekend was the weather - it still feels very much like winter in NYC!
