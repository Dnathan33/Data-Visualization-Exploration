Tuesday musings ðŸŒ±| Spring is a time for rebirth. I always hear of new resolutions during the first month of the year, but generally I like to track my resolutions during the spring -- I think because I feel invigorated by the days getting longer, and feeling the warm sunshine on my skin. I like to go through a cleanse as well, focusing on spiritual and physical growth and evolution. This years fast, which ends tomorrow has been one that has really allowed me to meditate on what's important, and set a high bar for my goad for the year. Happy spring, and happy renewal âœ¨
