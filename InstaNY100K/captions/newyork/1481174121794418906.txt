. . Pink daruma and silver daruma . I finished 14 small canvases in total. Since I made this studio I have painted for new canvases 19 in total in 34 days. The biggest one is 3.2*1.9ｍ for show in May, Tokyo. If I count with drawings, I have finished 23 artworks. I have been moving between two studios in Gunma and Saitama. And I often go to Tokyo to have  meeting and buy art tools. So, now, I need a break. Tomorrow I will not see artworks. That is my work of Tomorrow😅 Off  Off  Off ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 34th day for new canvases at my Gunma studio. . 21-24.4▶Art Expo Newyork / NYC 2-7.5▶SICF / Tokyo Summer▶Solo show at Modern Art Museum / Shanghai . #artstudio #当代艺术 #博物馆 #絵 #ダルマ #daruma #nature #Japan #color #artexpony #artexpo #artfairnyc #painting #artbasel #China #contemporaryart #abstractart #animal #shanghai #NY #NYC #nycart #artwork #museum #gallery #moma #artfair #NewYork #fashion
