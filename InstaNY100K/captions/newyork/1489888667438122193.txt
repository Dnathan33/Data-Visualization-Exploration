The observatory of the Empire State Building is great, because you don’t have to shoot through a dirty window and deal with reflections. If you are patient enough and wait for the right time, the view and the light can be pretty amazing. And don’t worry about all the people that step on your toes and stick their cameras in your face with the pop up flash open 😂 just keep calm and continue shooting. ~~~ Oh and thanks for all the love we got for our flatiron post from yesterday - that raised the bar for our next “most successful insta post” quite a bit 💚 ~~~~~~ #empirestatebuilding #esb #empirestate #empirestateview #manhattan #oneworldtradecenter #wotldtradecenter #1wtc #downtownmanhattan #downtownnyc #newyork #newyorkcity #nyc #what_i_saw_in_nyc #streetsofnyc #picturesofnewyork #nycvibes #nycityworld #urban #street #city #cityscape #citylights #bluehour #skyscraper #skyline
