I am so excited to introduce you to our Oak Hall that is launching into Macy's!â€¢ â€¢ Actually writing this out makes it sound slightly crazy...but here we go!  So while I love design and that is really why I started the company it is actually only about 1% of what I do out of the year and that I have even structured so that I only design in February so that I stay focused on the business â€¢ â€¢ Well that worked for a year or two but take a look at the blog to see what I had to do to beat my designers block!  It includes scheduling a flight to be alone, eating bacon flavored coconut (it exists and it rocked my world) and meeting an extrovert that was design driven!â€¢ â€¢ Because of this weird and crazy combo we are launching a collection that is being placed in ways that have never been done on the retail floor! â€¢ â€¢ Perseverance paid off and I can't wait to see it on the floor soon! ðŸ›«ðŸ¥“ðŸ—½ #EverythingIsBetterWithBacon #Pottery
