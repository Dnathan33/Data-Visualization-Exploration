Chung Seoyong "Ability vs Invisibility", TINA KIM GALLEERY While a week in New York, I saw only few Asian artist's exhibitions. Personally, I don't want to have a division when it comes to artworks such as by race or country, however they resemble their own back grounds and thoughts. Nowday, we can not deny the fact that if we deal with Asian artworks, they symbolized primary colors, religion, personal views etc.  Chung Seoyoung is South Korean Artist and she represents the diversity in this exhibition. She shows not only sculpture, but it includes photos, drawings, installation works and videoworks. Even they are just made by one artist, she emphasizes the essence of diversity in her artworks.  The two videoworks are funny for me. One is a person with a dog walking while others are sitting on the chair and some people don't move. Another is one sitting on the floor and woman is looking at them seems to be watching TV. This situation is similar to the art scene currently. Some people can stay away and others may stay. There are many sitting people from outside, new things will not happen. Thus, as I see it, it is funny and thought-provoking. #art #exhibition #artreview #exhibitionreview #contemporaryart #artwork #artworks #artist #gallery #sculpture #drawing #photo #photos #installation #video #videowork #NewYork #NYC #当代艺术 #當代藝術 #современноеискусство #zeitgenössischeKunst #artcontemporain #artecontemporanea #artecontemporaneo
