On a bad day, there is always lipstick -Audrey Hepburn  And Herbalife tea!  Today was the perfect sleep till tomorrow kind of day. It was cold, raining,dark and gloomy. But as much as the flat screen with netflix and the micro fleece throw on the sofa was calling my name, I got dressed, put on some lipstick, prepared my tea and went outside. And it set the tone for the rest of my day. I completed some errands, I went to the gym and had a great day with Zay! And all it took was some statement lipstick and some Herbalife!  #smile #vibes #inspo #rainyday #herbalife #livelaughlove #motivation #lipstick #audreyhepburn #bossbabe #fitmom #fitchick #inspo #pushyourself #yougotthis #newyork #latina
