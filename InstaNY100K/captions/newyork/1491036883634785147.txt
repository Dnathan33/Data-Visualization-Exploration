Spotted: Chelsea “You tend to see a lot of knockoffs of this particular shoe and it bums me out. I understand the desire for luxury goods, I mean I have it myself, but design is design. You don’t knockoff a building, you don’t knockoff a book cover, you don’t knockoff a book, you don’t knockoff a painting. I’ve gone into Forever 21 and seen stitch for stitch copies and I get it, but it’s just too bad.” #shoesofnyc [shop via link in profile]
