@riderbklyn 02.10.2017 The day before I hosted "New York Tastes Chef Wierdo" my mom and me had brunch at Rider literally after getting finishing a 14 hour car ride. When we walked we we were the only guests at the time so we had the whole place to ourselves. The service was amazing we were shown around the whole place from the top floor to the ballroom! Ordered the whole menu and they coursed it perfectly which really helped with last minute inspiration for my dinner the following day. I will be sure to stop by everytime I'm in New York! #rider #chefwierdo #newyork
