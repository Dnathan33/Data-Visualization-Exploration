@zoomwhitening I miss coffee 😩😫😫. I had the procedure done Monday and yesterday I was in more pain than I could have imagined, but the hardest thing was to walk by my coffee shop and go the whole day without caffeine. My teeth are white, but I'm cranky without my morning friend ☕️. #coffee, I miss you!  #zoom #whitening #nocoffee #noredwine #nofun
