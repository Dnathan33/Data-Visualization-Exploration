In loving memory of my best friend and mentor Dr. Max Link from his favourite view in his favourite city.  Hermann Hesse once said "The true profession of a man is to find his way to himself" - can't think of a better companion than him on this formidable journey.  May you rest in peace, dear friend.  #emptychairsatemptytables #newyork #ny #manhattan #centralpark #love #respect #longing #grief #friends #sunset #family
