The queue to get on the boat to go to the Statue of Liberty was, no joke, a mile long... in the midday heat. So naturally we were like naaaah pal and decided it was a Central Park kinda day. We ate pretzels and ice cream, lazed around and I maaaay have snuck into Bloomingdales and bought myself a lil summin' summin' 🙊🏙☀️ . . . #hazy #hothothot #cityheat #welcometonewyork #thebigapple #newyork #travel #usa #travelphotography #travelblog #america #blog #blogger #lifestyle #lblogger #instagood #newyorkcity #manhattan #tourist #nycvibes #newyorknewyork #centralpark #bloomingdales #littlebrownbag
