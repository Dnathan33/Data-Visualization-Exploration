Seminal performance artist Tehching Hsieh will represent Taiwan at this year's Venice Biennale. Best known for his five 'One Year Performances', Hsieh will present documentations and archival materials of his 'Outdoor Piece', for which he spent a year outdoor in the streets of New York, entering no shelter space. His work explores endurance, physical limits and the idea of time. . #tehchinghsieh #doingtime #venicebiennale #venicebiennale2017 #taiwanpavilion #performanceart #performance #adrianheathfield #outdoorpiece #endurance #time #newyork #newyorkcity #newyorkstreets
