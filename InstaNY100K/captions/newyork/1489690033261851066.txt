PEACE ‚úåüèª Two weeks ago I visited NYC for the 4th time. However, it was my first trip with @statuecruises all the way to this lady! The other times I just went with the free Staten Island Ferry. The experience is worth every penny. We paid $64 for 2 adults and 3 kids (DKK 450,-). I thought it would be crowded and not that big of a deal compared to the look from the ferry. But it's quite different to see her from this perspective. Bonus: There's a little cafe where you can buy a cup of tea. Bring it to one of the many benches and enjoy the view to Manhattan too. #newyorkbrix #newyork #nyc #statueofliberty #frihedsgudinden #usa #travellife #traveljournalist #newyorkshare #newyorkrejsetips #bureaubrixtravel
