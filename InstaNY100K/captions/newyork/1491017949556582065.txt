Sometimes I want to give up and soak myself into society. But HE CALLS ME. He calls me into places I fear. He showed me dreams and visions I feel like I can't accomplish because this twenty year old something is suppose to have her life together.  She's suppose to not worry, she's suppose to have a full time career, she's suppose to have money, she's suppose to never fail, she's suppose to save her dreams for later.  So waiting for God started to mean waiting for all these things to align and when nothing aligned depression creeps into life. To receive joy is to be obedient to your heart but that's been suppressed by others.  So now you're singing Moana's song "Know Who You Are" because your heart has been stolen from inside you and God has been calling you! He's been searching for you the way He called for Adam. Your dreams and passion, He wants to put that back into your heart BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE ðŸ˜­ #gowatchmoana #stylewithshoemaker
