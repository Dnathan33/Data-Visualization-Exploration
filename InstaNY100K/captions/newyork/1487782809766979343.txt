I'm so excited to be teaching Crystals and Angels 101 tomorrow at Among Angels in Halfmoon, New York! ❤  This class guides you in understanding how crystals and our angelic friends work to help and heal us, how to use crystals to heal your emotions, relationships, finances, and other life areas, as well as how to give clear and healing crystal readings to others! 💜  Today is the LAST DAY to register!
