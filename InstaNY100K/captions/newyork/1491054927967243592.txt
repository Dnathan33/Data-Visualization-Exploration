Visited the September 11 Memorial and Museum today.  It was a moving and incredibly emotional experience. Seeing the various videos and exhibitions brought that day right back into the present. I can remember to the minute each moment from hearing about the first plane and no one knowing what exactly was going on, to the horror of realizing that this was a calculated attack, to all of us huddled together on  twin dorm bed at UM watching the TV trying to figure out the hows and whys and what nows. All of this happened within minutes but time stretched out painfully slow as we watched and it felt like it would never end. And then hearing the last messages from people on the planes or in the buildings. The sheer heartbreak of it all. There are not enough words to express the sorrow surrounding the tragedy. In walking through the museum all I could think was how could anyone see this and not be moved? People should remember that this attack took away people of all ages, gender, races, religions, and orientations. And that all walks of life came together to help and support. The last messages that came through  were of hope and love. We can achieve more through compassion and understanding than through fear and prejudice. Everyone could benefit from a visit through this museum, especially these days!  #911 #memorial #museum #newyork #worldtradecenter #lovenothate #remember
