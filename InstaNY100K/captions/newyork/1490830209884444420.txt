Today's feature, (fact 44, for those of you keeping track at home), is the Northern Spur Preserve, a small appendix to the High Line that stops at a wall (there used to be an entrance here to a warehouse which stored frozen foods). This section of the High Line is recreated to appear just as it would have before the parkâ€™s reconstruction ðŸŒ¾. Here, you can see the original greenery that sprouted all over the High Line prior to its complete overhaul, thanks to the park's planting designer, Piet Oudolf. The dominating philosophy behind his landscaping choices (and their success) is the attention to texture, shape, colour, and, most of all longevity â€” native perennial flowers, shrubs, and grasses dominate the park so that the gardens may be sustainable as well as interesting year-round. ðŸš© Walk the High Line tour and get a look at the rich history of the park and the Meatpacking district on the Urban Walks app: simply click ðŸ”— in bio to download.
