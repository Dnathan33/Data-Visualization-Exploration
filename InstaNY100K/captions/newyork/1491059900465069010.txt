The Starry Night and #theHAINAKUbook, #hainaku, just a few hours ago at the MoMA, on a trip to New York.  Apropos to last night's conversation on my Viber group about failure on the part of our brothers or sisters, sons or daughters, anyone we love, including ourselves, and how we challenge it, nurture it, enable it, change it, or pick it up.  The Starry Night is one of many Vincent Van Gogh painted from his view of "the Wheatfield, the Mountain, the Orchard, the Olive trees with the blue hills and the Portrait and the Entrance to the quarry" through his bedroom window at Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum in Provence, in which he checked himself after a bout of depression resulting in the self-mutilation of his ear.  It was the only nocturne in the series and one of three he kept to himself, instead of sending to his brother in Paris because he considered it a "failure," not worth the money he would have had to spend on postage.  These Van Gogh reminscences are brought to you by my friend Suiee Suarez who at the moment is on the first leg of his US trip with the family.  So, so thankful for taking my poems along with you, Suiee!  #vangogh #starrynight #poetry #poems #poetsofinstagram #aapoetry #mybooksjourney2 #MoMA #newyork
