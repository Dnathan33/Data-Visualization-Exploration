In #Lao dancing, hand movement is so graceful so I enjoy paying attention to mine in asana. Next weekend is Lao New Year!!! I used to love it when I was a kid but now it's just endless pranks, supersoakers, and Johnny Walker Black for 2 wks (no repercussions.. just karma 🤷🏻‍♀️). If you want a career in physical comedy, go to SE Asia in April. 📷: @maya.p.c #lamvong aka #laojazzhands #spiritfingers #laonewyear #laopeopleproblems . . . . . #yoga#yogaeveryday#yogalife#ytt#studio#laos#laonewyear#songkran#peace#happiness#mudras#tranquility#love#joy#thailand#cambodia#southeastasia#nyc#newyork#newyorkyoga#om#yogahands#fitspo#lighting#naturallight
