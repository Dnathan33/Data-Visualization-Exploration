From Kala🚴🏾‍♀️: "Today was a GREAT 🌞day! I successfully rode 15 miles 🚲around my city to get from point A to B. Most recently ❤️I was asked what keeps me going 💨and I responded💜 'LOVE'💚. Love for what I do with Girls On Bikes 🚴🏾‍♀️💓& everything else. If I had to give advice🌼, I would say 'Do what you love🤗, and not what anyone else wants or thinks you should do.'
