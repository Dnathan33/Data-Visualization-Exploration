And a very happy #nationalpetday to Cooper and my girl, Mystic, who's watching over us. You're all familiar with Cooper and his antics... how crazy and lovable he is ðŸ˜ŠI just wish you all (and Cooper) would have had the chance to meet Mystic! We rescued her from the same shelter, North Shore Animal League, and she was in my life for 13 years. She was the most gentle dog you could ever meet! Her and Cooper would have been the best of adopted siblings. When we were filling out our pre adoption approval form, we described what traits we loved in Mystic and they brought to us this perfect little split faced pup! I feel so blessed for the pups I've had in my life ðŸ’—
