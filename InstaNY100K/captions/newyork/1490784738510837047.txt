Just got back home from preforming at the Apollo theatre in New York with my jazz choir!! This is probably the best trip I've ever taken in my life and woke up feeling sad that I wasn't there anymore. Will never forget the feeling of preforming where all the professionals have. #newyork #timessquare #theapollotheatre #jazz #music #trip
