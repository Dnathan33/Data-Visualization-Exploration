To America,  Thank you for the American Dream; for allowing people in other countries to have the opportunity to develop and grow. Thank you for teaching us that with hard work, and with blood, sweat, tears and heart, we can do anything we put our mind to. The American Dream is an idea that continues to inspire me, and millions of other people, but it's important to not forget what it truly means. It is not about attaining greatness from doing nothing. It is about attaining greatness through hard work and sacrifice. Nothing is free, but hard work is truly priceless.  Thank you for letting your citizens grow in diversity. Thank you for celebrating your people's differences. Thank you for allowing all walks of life to enjoy your beauty, life and freedom.  #newyork #usa
