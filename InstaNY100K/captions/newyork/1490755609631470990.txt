In the summer of 2016 I went to New York City (destination: Brooklyn) to shoot material for Project Z. While I was only in NYC for a mere 4 hours, I walked across Manhattan, and deep into Brooklyn. Through which I crossed The Williamsburg Bridge. Typically crossing a bridge isn’t anything special. However, I was carrying around 30 pounds of photography gear on my back. Now again, this isn’t really anything special…BUT: I was out of shape, it was around 90+ degrees, and this bridge is F@#KING LONG! (Or at least it felt that way!) Needless to say I was a disgusting ball of sweat when I got to my destination, and incredibly thirsty!! Fortunately, the people at my destination were cool with how the human body cools itself. Sadly I have no pictures of this scenario. As for Project Z, I’m still hard at work on this piece (I thought I would have this finished in December of last year…I give that a big “HA!!”). The biggest challenge is the extreme limitation of my chosen medium… but that’s part of the fun in it! Trying to figure out how to do something that hasn’t been done, is a total thrill – besides saving the items from the landfill. Stay tuned!! **Project Z is my current piece in production to which I'm giving away a single edition print to the first person who can answer 4 questions before I release the original!
