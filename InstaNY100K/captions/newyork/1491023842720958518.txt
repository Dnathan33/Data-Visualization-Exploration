You're probably thinking I'm crazy- painting over the face. Truth be told, I wasn't going to share this part, just as I didn't with my elephant- because it scares me. Lol. But, I've come to realize that this is how I work. The first color blocking painting I do is more of a trial run. Putting things in place. This is what happens next, followed by bringing the colors back. Anyone else do this?
