WEEGEE” LENDS A HELPING HAND - New York – Down at the Bronx Terminal Market, 151st and Exterior sts, to cover the picketing by retail dealers, photographer “Weegee” got into the swing of things and carried a placard for the picketers. Here, he holds up the sign denouncing black marketeers, all the while puffing on his big cigar and keeping his camera handy for a good picture. The market was picketed by dealers protesting the black market and tie-in sales. – Weegee 29/5-1945 📸 #weegee #newyork #fotografiska
