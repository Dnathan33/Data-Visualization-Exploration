Expect to see God’s goodness, not just in heaven when you die, but in the everyday activities of your life here on earth. • His faithfulness is without question.  His generosity is perfect.  His affection is tender and loving.  His presence is permanent.  His love and acceptance is unconditional. His plans are big.  His authority is right and true. His favor lasts a lifetime. • Have absolute confidence in the goodness of God, not because of your circumstances but in spite of them. . #architecture #skyline #NYC #newyork #washingtonsquare #sky #igaddict #igers #igersnyc #2017 #yearoflight
