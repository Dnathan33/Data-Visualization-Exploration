HAPPY BIRTHDAY NANA!!!!!! â € My grandma was born on Palm Sunday so our great-grandparents named her Grace Palma Ferdinand. She is truly an angel, and I would not be half of the woman that I am today without her love, guidance, and support. â € I cannot wait to see you this week and eat cake, make yummy new deserts and celebrate your favorite holiday, Easter. â € Sending you all of my love ðŸ’•ðŸŽ‚ðŸ’• .â € .â € .â € .â € .â € #fashion #fashionblogger #fashionblog #style #styleblogger #styleblog #lifestyle #lifestyleblogger #bloggerstyle #blogger #newyork #newyorkcity #manhattan #newyorkcity #streetstyle #citylife #petitejoys #thatsdarling #liveauthentic #prettyinpink #acolorstory #newyorkblogger #spring #monday #mondayvibes #vibes  #newyorker #happybirthday
