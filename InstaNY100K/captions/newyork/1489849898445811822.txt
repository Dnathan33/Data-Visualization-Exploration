Being impatient won't take you anywhere in life. Be calm, be very calm, good things always takes time.  Work hard or try to work hard, even if your not getting result now or later, you will get them one day.  Remember hard work always pay off. Whatever you do, where ever in life you are.  Start taking stand for your self, don't blame others for your life decision, if you don't like anything, change. Your not a tree.  Never point fingers on others, if something bad happened it to you, it's your mistake, say sorry to yourself and then work harder than before. Mistakes are bound to happen, we all are human, we all make mistakes, once you accept yourself then you will spread the love in you to others. #selflove #mondaymotivation #newyork #brooklyn #teamusa #desifit  #winter #newday #newme #Pakiboy #dccolonyboyz #Lahore #Pakistan #peace #2017 #dedication #determination #goodthings #discipline #onesimplechange #instafitness #healthyminds #decisions
