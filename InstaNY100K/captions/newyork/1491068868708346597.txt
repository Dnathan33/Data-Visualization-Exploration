âœ¨A lil Advice: picture yourself âœ¨ â€¢ In every great life transition, it may be hard to see yourself in a new world, living your everyday life. Don't worry, darling. We continuously change throughout our lives and this may just be the next edition. It just depends if you like the person you picture. Is this who you want to be then? Will you still be happy if you don't change, and live this life as who you are at this moment? All questions to ask before you commit to that life change (especially if it's going off to college and choosing the lifestyle you want for many years to come). â€¢ (ðŸ“¸: @farahpro)
