I moved to Canc√∫n! As soon as I arrived at the city centre, I saw Mark wondering around with his backpack, just like me. We walked together trying to find Hostel Quetzla, where I was supposed to stay. He's really a nice guy, and he surprised me cause he comes from Wicklow, one of the best place I've ever been to!  #humansalongtheway #whatIlearnfrompeople #newyork
