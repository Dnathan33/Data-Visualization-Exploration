#Repost @frankiesfelinefund with @repostapp ・・・ This is Linus, and we need a VERY special foster or adopter for him.  Linus has a serious history of constipation and has been diagnosed with megacolon.  He has undergone some very invasive procedures to try and treat his condition. His family has been told what medications to administer but I guess Linus is too much trouble. It is extremely important that the diet and medications be given as prescribed.  We are hoping this works, if not there is an expensive surgical procedure which we have first hand knowledge can work but it depending on the extent of damage to the colon.  The best situation for Linus would be a single cat environment so he gets the food he needs in the correct quantity and his meds on time.  This way his bowel movements can also be monitored.  Since right now Linus needs close medical supervision it would be best if he stayed in the New York area.  This guy deserves a chance at a normal life- not to be tossed aside like his family has done. •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••#nyc #newyork #newjersey #pleasehelp #adopt #adoptdontshop #sheltercat #seniorcat #handsome #cat #cats #catsofinstagram #catlover #animallover #catstagram #feline #savealife #queens #harlem #brooklyn #manhatten #feline  #tuxedo #rescueismyfavoritebreed #longhair#fosteringsaveslives #whitecat
