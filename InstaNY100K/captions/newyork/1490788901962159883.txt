Little Neck Bay from the Long Island Rail Road. Over 20 years ago I went for a sail out there. I was a terrified little six year old on my first sail. The awesome adventure, sailing under awesome bridges and the New York City skyline kept me coming back. I'm glad I kept at it for all these years. Who could have imagined back then where sailing has taken me now. #sentimental ...................................................................................#instagood #me #tbt #photooftheday #happy #beautiful #self #picoftheday #swag #amazing #life #sun #art #nature #sky #yachting #yachtracing #nyc #aroundtheworld #yachts #sailing #photography #sails #newyork #longisland #boats #ocean #sea #beauty
