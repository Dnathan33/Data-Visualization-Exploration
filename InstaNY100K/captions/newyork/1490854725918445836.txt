I spent my day re-reading one of my favorite books by @cherylstrayed, Tiny Beautiful Things. Every time I read it, I find exactly what I've wanted to say but didn't know how to. This but was all about squandering life by way of mimicking it. It's the best feeling in the world to know who you are, what your capable of, and what your big picture direction is. But it makes the imitation of others seem like a total waste. There's room for every one to walk their own road in their own way. Living a life mapped out by someone else seems like real misuse to me. #SLKintheUSA #ontheblog #canadiantuxedo #readmorebooks
