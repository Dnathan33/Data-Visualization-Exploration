I am starting to love the willful ignorance of New Yorkers, the ability to look at the epic and beautiful and quickly put it into context. It's a skill that comes from the skyline; we see something that magnificent every day and somehow go on living. A back-drop like that will dominate you unless you learn to become a part of it, and that's what New Yorkers do. Become towers. #newyork #nyc #skyline #weekend #friends #bw #shadow #sun #manhattan #nj #newjersey #guy #sunglasses #denim
