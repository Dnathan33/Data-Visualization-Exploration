Sweet Ailsa is still looking for a home to call her own! She is very friendly, crate-trained, housebroken, spayed, up to date on vaccinations and knows all basic commands. She is not a chewer and is well behaved.  Ailsa is good with kids and other dogs, but will do best in a home without cats. She is an independent girl who can spend hours entertaining herself with toys. She has diabetes, which is easily managed with an insulin shot twice daily. Ailsa currently weighs 60lbs, but still needs to put on additional weight.  Apply to adopt Ailsa today: rescuedogsrocknyc.org  #rescuedogsrocknyc #AilsaRDRNYC #adoptdontshop #RDRNYC
