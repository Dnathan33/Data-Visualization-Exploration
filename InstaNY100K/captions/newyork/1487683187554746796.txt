Woke up super excited that something that was ending today sold, but then.... realizing it sold for $14 free shipping and realizing it's $13 dollars to ship it!!!!!!!!!!!! It weighs only 30grams. Insanity. The max allowed in a greeting card under one stamp is 50g I'm pretty sure. Debating. In other news, got this beautiful brand new leather Calvin Klein wristlet which will be up on eBay today!! #calvinklein
