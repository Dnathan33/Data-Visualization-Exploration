Good morning from beautiful Manhattan. I had a wonderful Tuesday with someone very special and I'm preparing for a busy Wednesday ahead. I've been doing a lot of thinking, and I know this already, but it's good to reinforce things every so often. Life will only change when you become more committed to your dreams than you are to your comfort zone. With that said, spread those wings and fly everyone... #goodmorning #morning #morninginspiration #manhattan #newyork #soho
