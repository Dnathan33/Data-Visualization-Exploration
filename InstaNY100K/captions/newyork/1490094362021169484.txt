For the last 3 years I have spent all or the majority of 2 weeks with @chantellemc84 on some sort of adventure at this time. Be it going to Coachella, going up the Empire state, getting drunk in New York, Vegas and New Orleans... whoops I didn't think we got drunk alot ha. All this wouldn't of happened if she didn't offer me a free ticket to see my favourite band. Little did I know I would come away with much more than  a free gig. I gained the other half of hot cherry. A friend for life. Although we are not on travels, we will make up for it next year!! Here's one from Nola #neworleans #nola #travel #friends #friendship #memories #timehopsakiller #america #newyork #whathappensinvegasstaysinvegas #coachella
