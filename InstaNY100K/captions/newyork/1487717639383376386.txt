After going back and forth with myself about this piece I've come to the point where it's time to separate from my baby. "Xena's Tears" is officially ON SALE for $120 this is a 24"x36" canvas and is all original. This is a very near and dear piece to me and I'm sure her future home will fit even better. FOR PURCHASE DETAILS PLEASE DM ME FOR MORE INFORMATION. 👳🏾📿🙏🏾🎨🌺🌊🏄🏾🌊❤️💔❤️🚶🏾 #x170konscioussociety #artwork #stars #kemet #space #art #spraypaint #spraypaintart #cltartist #charlotte #noda #artcollection #work #paint #dopeart #atlantaart #newyork #angel #africa #47thkhamber #supportblackart #blackart #blackartist #supportblackbusiness #selfmade #locs #loner #hippy #cosmos #galaxy
