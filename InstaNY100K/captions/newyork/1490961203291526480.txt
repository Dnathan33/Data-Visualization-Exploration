“This yoga teacher training was transformational for my life. I grew inwardly the strength to be able to share outwardly through teaching yoga. I grew in confidence through facing fears. I was supported in a safe space well I grew and messed up and tried new things. I’m very thankful for this teacher training that was available in New Paltz for our community. Maggie, Michael and Preston led us in a somatic journey through the Gita, the chakras, the Yamas and Niyamas gracefully. The adjustment practice and teachings created all strong and alert yoga teachers.” 2016 graduate of Vitality yoga teacher training
