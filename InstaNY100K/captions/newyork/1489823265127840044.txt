I found it incredibly disrespectful for people to be smiling in selfies at the 9/11 memorial as if it's just another attraction to tick off the bucket list. It's the one place I wouldn't think of smiling at the camera for.  In memory of all the lives lost in the 9/11, gone but never forgotten. #911memorial#newyork#oneworldtradecenter#flynyon
