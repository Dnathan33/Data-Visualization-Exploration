#shortstory #drawing #people #newyork #eastvillage #american The other day, I met Justin. Justin is another real estate agent I met in East Village. He was a young guy in his 20s with brown and short hair, a true american born and raised in New York, easy to talk to. He has never visited Paris, only Nice and Marseille but he would love to. He was also looking for an apartment, but over time, he said he has become picky. According to him, January and February are the best months to look for an apartment. Because of freezing cold days, new yorkers don't like moving out, that's why you can get better renting offerd during those periods.
