As some of you may know, my dear mom passed away a few days ago. I don't like posting my personal life on social media but I feel this is necessary. With the help of my brothers @masterpieces562 @flattxbrims @yayo_vee  I have created a t-shirt design from an illustration that I drew while being in the hospital with my mom. All proceeds from the sales will go towards the funeral expenses. DM me if you're interested. As always, thanks for your support.
