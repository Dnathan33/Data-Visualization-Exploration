Had the great pleasure of contributing a tiny morsel to the album Piss Up by these very cool dudes C.O.F.F.I.N  They were good enough to come to my gig and I was rapt they invited me into the Pet Food Factory to enjoin some inter-generational suburban surf punk with Jay of Frenzal Rhomb at the desk. Join the Piss Up, everybody is invited. Out some time in the future. #suburbanboy #convictstreak #music #album #punk #northernbeaches #newyork #roma #rock #sydney #manly #COFFIN #recording #berlin #surf #frenzalrhomb
