There are no "participation trophies" handed out in this town! You must stay on the grind like someone is trying to take it all away! There is competition everywhere! Some may have a better education, some may have come from a better part of town, but that does not mean they will have the same amount of passion! #bringit  #experience #success #workharder #growth #mindset #grind #newyork #effort #dontsettle
