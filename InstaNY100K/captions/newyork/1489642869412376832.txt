Park Avenue Armory, for Eugene O'Neill's The Hairy Ape, with a powerful Bobby Cannavale (and David Costabile - Gale from Breaking Bad! - doing a decent Irish accent). The venue is AMAZING! Stage rotates around the audience, making use of the massive drill hall, drinks and actors mingling afterwards in the beautiful wood-panelled rooms. #parkavenuearmory #thehairyape #paahairyape #eugeneoneill #bobbycannavale #davidcostabile #theatre #newyork #drillhall
