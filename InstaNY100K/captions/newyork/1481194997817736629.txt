·🏈💰🔮 Odell Beckham, Jr. Contract Projection HT: 5-11 WT: 198 Age: 24 Seasons: 3 Status: 2019 UFA (with 5th-Year Option - 5YO) · •🔍Scouting Report · ➕Some best/biggest hands in NFL. The catch. Excellent athlete - top-tier speed, agility, acceleration, leaping ability. Great route runner Can beat CB press and off coverage. Elite playmaker after the catch; slants and screens go for huge chunks/TD. One of NFL's premier talents. · ➖Temper/tantrums are biggest issues (CAR, 2015). Defenders can get into head. Seems to struggle under intense scrutiny. He’s also dealt w/ frustration drops. · •📈Stats Best Season: 96 REC, 1,450 YDS, 96.7 YPG, 13 TD (2015) Career Statistics: 43 GMS, 288 REC, 4,122 YDS, 95.9 YPG, 35 TD · •📊Player Comparables ·#AntonioBrown, #Steelers ·#JulioJones, #Falcons ·#AJGreen, #Bengals · 📊Contract Comparison (Photo 2 above) · 📊Statistical Comparison (Photo 3 above) Annual averages for players 2 years prior to signing. · •⚖️Leverage Brown, Green and Jones had one year left on deals. OBJ has 2 years remaining on his (including 5YO). Production through 1st 3 years can stand w/ any WR in NFL history. · A sports icon who brings attention (revenue) to NYG that extends beyond his play. Like his diva personality or not, teams don’t let superstars go. · NYG have him under contract (including 5YO) for the next 2 seasons at under $15 million total. Deal probably won’t happen until next year; projection would change. Team could franchise OBJ twice (3rd tag is cost-prohibitive). Would keep him in NY for 4 years below market value. · •🏃🏽Reservation Price Highest-paid wide receiver in NFL history. Point. Blank. Period.  Whether Jones or Brown is the league’s top wide receiver is irrelevant; Beckham's got next. Other WRs signing (Evans, Hopkins, Watkins, Landry, Jeffery, Pryor, etc.) could also change WR market before OBJ signs. · If he was a UFA, Beckham almost certainly be able to find suitor at over $20M APY today. · •💰Projection: 5 years, $90M; $18M AVG, $43.5M FG, $50M GTD · •📝Contract Structure (Photo 4)
