The fourth release in #Bruichladdich's DNA series was distilled in 1985. Aged for 27 years, this is toasty with notes of tropical fruit and spice. A very rare and elegant whisky.  #whiskygents #gentlemen #vancouver#london #california #scotland #toronto#newyork #scotch #singlemalt#scotchwhisky #Kentucky #bourbon#whisky #whiskey
