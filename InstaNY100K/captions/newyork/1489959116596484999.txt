This Thursday I will be doing an event for Paragon Sports NYC as they celebrate the grand opening of their new footwear department.  I will be representing my @ecentrikartistry brand doing some minor customization work.  If you're in the NY area here's your chance to get your own sample of custom shoe art (and meet yours truly). There will be food and drinks as well.  21 east 17th Street (near Union Square) from 6 - 8:30pm.  Stop by and invite your friends! . #elombowmanart #ecentrikartistry #nyc #paragonsports #newyorkartists #nyc #newyork #unionsquare
