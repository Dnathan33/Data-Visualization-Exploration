Marketing tip! ðŸ’¡  Marketing off-line is still IN.  We meet with clients every week! I know that's unheard of these days, but it makes all the difference. Meeting with clients whether face to face or on a conference call, makes them less likely to cancel their services. It gives us upsell opportunities and referrals. Can't beat it! Networking events are a great way to get your name and business out there. Want to become and influencer in your industry? Go to as many live networking events as possible. It works! Meet lots of people, follow up and slowly, but surely,  you will become a recognized name in your industry.  Check out our #MINUTEMONDAY video on  #influencermarketing later today on #YouTube  Happy Monday! :) xoxo, Violet  Follow ðŸ‘‰ @TeloivMediaGrp . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . #teloivmediagroup #newyorkcity #newyork #digitalagency #digitalmarketing #onlinemarketing #marketingoffline #networking #blog #blogger #sales #marketing #influencer #success #grind #hustle #bossbabe #mompreneur #entrepreneur #entrepreneurlife #businessowner #solopreneur #businesswoman #businessman #businesstips #branding #socialmedia
