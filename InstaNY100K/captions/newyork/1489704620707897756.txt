04.08.17: The last 10 days was an experience of a lifetime, with memories that I soon will not forget; spent with the one I love... From meeting her parents and family, to all the sights of New York, Philadelphia, and New Jersey, to checking things off of my bucket list. I was able to spend time slowly in peace, and witnessed lots of beautiful things with rich history... I learned too while on vacation. I got to experience first hand the rush and chaos of many people in small quarters. There was this one moment when this older gentleman stood up in front of me while I was trying to take a picture, and instead of thinking negatively and reacting, I thought to myself that this person too paid the same price as I did to experience these places, that they too should be able to enjoy and witness the fruits of their hard earned labor. I thought that for some, this may be their first and last time being where we were, and that maybe some had spent a lifetime of wishing to see these sights, and it brought everything to calm; I thought to myself that this was someone's father, grandfather, brother... Then I thought of my own father and family. Thank you for sharing this experience with me my dear, this was one of the happiest 10 days of my life. #Love #StrawberryFields #JohnLennon #Beatles #Imagine #CentralPark #NewYork #NewYorkCity #NYC
