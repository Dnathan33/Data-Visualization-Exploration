This bear used to be mine when I was younger. I got it from my grandparents just before we made the trans-atlantic move from Munich to Toronto. We gave it to Isabelle when our little family moved back to Toronto from Munich (where we lived for a couple of years and where Isabelle was born). A few months back Isabelle gifted it to Nicolas because he didn’t have an animal that was just his and these two have been inseparable ever since. I’m not nostalgic about all too many things, but seeing my baby boy love on his “Knut” who has travelled the world with me and now with my kids, it’s pretty darn special. ❤ #ihavethisthingwithwindows
