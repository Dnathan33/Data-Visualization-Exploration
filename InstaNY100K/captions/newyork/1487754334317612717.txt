This was taken after a snowstorm this winter. My area got over 134 inches of snow. Even though it's officially Spring, it's still snowing here. 3 more inches of snow expected today  #newyork #syracuse #blizzard #upstateny #northcountry #ny #snow #storm #nature #outdoors #weather #schnee #winter #sturm #fr√ºhling #tughill #watertown #fortdrum
