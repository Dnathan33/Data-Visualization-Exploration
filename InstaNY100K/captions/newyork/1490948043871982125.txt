Been doing a lot of self reflecting over a dispute I had with a client yesterday. I make a mistake and essentially embarrassed her by confronting her request which I believed was not appropriate. However as a representative of the business, I was out of line and was inappropriate to point out the request. Lesson learned and we move on. But still, it stings a little to be called names even if you know they are not the truth. The best I could do was stand there and let her vent and yell because I did not care to have the situation escalate even further. I apologized more times then I could remember and knowing that she will always be upset just made me a little blue. And as I stand here from her point of view, I try to take in her needs and wants and ultimately understand she is doing the best she can do for her family. And that's why she made her request. #plastic #floor #construction #fixthisfloor #blue #empathy #walkinmyshoes #dispute #imsorry #newyork #work
