Italy is one of the leading countries in fashion design, alongside others such as France, United States, United Kingdom, Germany and Japan. Fashion has always been an important part of the country's cultural life and society, and Italians are well known for their attention of dressing-up well; "la bella figura", or good impression, remains traditional. #italy #fashionphotography #fashionshoot #mode #instastyle #newyorkfashionweek #nyfw #high #fashion #menwithstyle #mensstyle #menswear #mensweardaily #menstyleguide #fashionstylist #fashionworld  #photography #fashionshoot #mode #instastyle #newyorkfashionweek #newyork #highfashion #menwithstyle #mens #style #menswear #menswear  #menstyle  #guide #formenttstyleformen #styleof #styleblogger #styleinspiration
