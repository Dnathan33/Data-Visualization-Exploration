The field of medicine (and plastic surgery particular) is full of innovations and "firsts". Many people judge "victory" as being the "first". This pertains to new techniques, procedures and products such as fillers and injectables. While being the "first" is admirable, it should not be the sole measure of victory. Instead, some choose to sit back and observe the experience of these "firsts", making adjustments based on the successes and failures, in order to provide the safest and highest quality result. When you look back in history, many of the "firsts" were indeed trailblazers, but refinements have improved upon what they were the first to do. That is the true victory. . . . This can apply to virtually any profession or industry. Share and like if you agree. . . . To see Dr. Schulman perform his surgeries live, make sure to follow him on #snapchat (nycplasticsurg).
