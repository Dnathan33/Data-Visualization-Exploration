Lyssna på Kingsizemag.se 🎤👑 Nu håller vi tummarna för nytt Nasty Nas-album under 2017! 💥 "Angels with dirty faces, angels with broken wings The devil's dust, PCP, invaded blood streams People lining up to get it, Fantastic knew how to flip it Illegal substances constructing, but plus addicted Trust it and respect it, almost got me arrested All of the time I invested in school is now of question Child prone to violence like a dog returns to its own father The fool for chaos, taking what we can salvage Hustling is an art, I'm just trying to be smart Strung our bodies out in the park, Shaolin was my heart..." #nas #angeldust #netflix #thegetdown #newyork #nastynas
