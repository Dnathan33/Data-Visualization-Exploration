“…Like everybody, I carry around in my head this museum without walls. But after a certain point this museum without walls becomes not a liberating thing; suddenly it makes walls and it hems you in; and you have to break away from it. And the only way you can do that is to try to find out who you are. And this is, I suppose, a universal problem for artists.” – Adolph Gottlieb, from a 1959 panel at the @Metropolitan Museum of Art by the International Association of Art Critics.
