Thank you so much for an incredible adventure at the Bronx Zoo. From Red Pandas and Eagles, to Okapi and Gorillas, it was one of my favorite days. And I'm so glad I had you to share the day with. ❤️ P.S. I love that Supergirl jacket! (She's wearing the "S," guys!) #bronxzoo #thebronx #newyork #supergirl #mysuperwoman
