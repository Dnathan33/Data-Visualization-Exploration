I remember seeing photos of the iconic Amanda Lepore in pages of David LaChapelle's books when I was a teenager... those books inspired me to one day create my own book.. and now I am proud to say that I made it into the pages of Amanda's book too!! Here is one of the pages of her new Memoir "Doll Parts" out April 18th. Congratulations Amanda!! Such an honor to work with you and be a part of your new book.
