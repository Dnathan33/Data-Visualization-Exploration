I honestly can't believe I have the man of my dreams. I can say that being found by the love of your life isn't the easiest thing because you go from that happy feeling that makes you cry with a vibration pulsing through your body when he found you too to never wanting anything to happen to them and worrying to remembering you are GOD as BLACK WOMAN. My reflection is everything I dreamed up and things I didn't even know I wanted or know I needed. There is no other guy that I find as attractive and there are some pretty attractive men in my life. He does something to my soul. He is perfect. He treats me like his Queen and his God. He knows himself. He wants to grow. He gives me space to grow and be a free spirit while trusting I would never give his yoni or universe to anyone else because I give him complete honesty and transparency. A guy who is the answer to everything you prayed for your whole life. When you realize that he found you, told you he loved you first, wants to buy you a ring even though you natural and don't live by Babylon standards and don't need it but because your his and prides you enough that he wants to, will move across the USA for you and then across the country with you to Costa Rica. I always asked for a sign and a big one because I was slow and always analyzing and doubting. If we are all in a dream this is the best dream I've honestly ever had. This man knows all my secrets and trauma things I've never told things to that were exes with me for years. Moral of the story. This my man you don't like it. Please suck the fattest dick you ever could find and choke on it!! #love #melanin #blacklove #blackrelationships #awakening #mylovesbetterthanyours #kiss #baby #blackkings #blackqueens #thirdeye #yoga #meditation #melanted #natural #afro #relationships #joy #peace #1111 #growth #naturalhairjourney #africa #newyork #texas #indiana #blackpower #problack  #god #blackempowerment ðŸ’œðŸ’œðŸ’œ
