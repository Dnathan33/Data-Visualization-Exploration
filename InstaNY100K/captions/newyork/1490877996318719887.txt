"If the pot no longer suites you, simply step out of that which contains you -Steffy ." • CON·TAIN • kənˈtān/ • verb • :have or hold (someone or something) within; control or restrain (oneself or a feeling). We often find ourselves in situations that no longer serve us. And what do I mean by serve? You're stagnant in a #relationship, where conversations barely dive deep, & just shallow responses, "im good" to unconscious questions like "How Are You". Take the reigns to your life again! Do something different everyday! Wake up from this unconscious sleep! Simply remove yourself from that which doesn't serve you anymore. #TransformationTuesday #grow #growth #try #love #selflove #blessed #photochallenge #day4 #photosbysmagicsmooth #flowers #NYC #newyork
