In honor of the Chris Breezy concert coming up next week. I often post pics and have captions in them and some of you all will still make up your own story line so I'm going to go ahead and let you all make up the caption for these pics as well. However you see Chris Breezy auntie Christine in the front left in which is the one who he mentions on the DTLR interview as the one who is his inspiration for his clothing line Black Pyramid. And his mother Joyce in the back. One thing that I love about life is that if you allow yourself to be positioned to win then, "OH YOU GONE WIN!" ü§ôüèºü§ì
