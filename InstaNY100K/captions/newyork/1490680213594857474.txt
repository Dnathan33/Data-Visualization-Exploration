Don't you love it when a "plan" comes together?  NO time for photos, as this had a buyer within days of listing. This Pre-war,  co-op located on 304 West 75th Street is a newly renovated two-1 bedroom apartments, with fireplace and views of Hudson River and NJ skyline.  Congratulations to our buyers and sellers!! . . . . #buy #sell #apartment #newyork #city #realestate #douglaselliman #team #work #manhattan
