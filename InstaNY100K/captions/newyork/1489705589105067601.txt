This just came up in my #Timehop. This is maybe one of the oddest (& #best!) #nyc murals. Look closely. There is a giant clock under police mounted on horses. This is above the goblin dry cleaning establishment. Some of the goblin dry cleaners also play instruments and stand guard around a staircase that leads to nowhere.... ALSO, there are faux 3D #facade details painted around the fire escape for added effect. It kills me. Go see! 🌟😱 I did some digging & apparently the developer across the street wanted his #building's new inhabitants to have something lovely to look at, so he hired artist Richard Haas to create this mysterious goblin dry cleaner #mural (it's at the corner of 83rd #Street & York Avenue). Seriously. I #love it. I have spent HOURS looking at, studying it, photographing it, utterly convinced that it's a portal to another dimension. I'll post more photos so you can see the details. *I got the background info from UntappedCities. #newyork #uppereastside #art #madness #streetart #streetstyle #streetphotography #streetarteverywhere #afternoon #delight #discovery #travel #architecture #architecturephotography #design #beautifuldestinations #weird #painting #goblin #jobs #wanderlust  #love. 💕✨👍🏻🖖🏻
