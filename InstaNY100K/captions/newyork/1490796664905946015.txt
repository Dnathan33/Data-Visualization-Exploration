I have never been so close to missing a plane last night (except that one time when I actually missed it ðŸ˜‚) I feel like security guards in New York airport think that they are some sort of Airport Gods and can decide who will board the plane and who will not, I also feel that as soon as they see that you are in a hurry, they will start doing everything suuuupeeerrr slooow, talking to others and just making you stress, cry and beg. I have arrived to the JFK 2.5 hours in advance and boarded my plane 3 minutes before departure. But it was still awesome to see my bro @elektrotrendy during my short layover, walk Times Square at night with that terrible stinky pretzel ðŸ˜‚ Now off to my final destination!  Have you ever missed a flight? #newyork #timessquare #us
