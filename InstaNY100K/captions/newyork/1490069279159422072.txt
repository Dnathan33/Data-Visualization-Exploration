#DogDayMonday: Recently, ATF K-9 Dolly and her special agent handler helped other law enforcement officials and K-9s work the first round of the@ncaa_march_madness_2017 in Buffalo, NY.  ATF is a leading source of specially trained explosives detection canines (EDC). ATF's EDCs, like Dolly, are capable of detecting a variety of different explosive formulations, making them a valuable resource to law enforcement for locating explosives and firearms-related evidence. As such, they are frequently requested by our federal, state, and local partners to help investigators seek out explosives, guns and spent ammunition evidence in violent crime investigations. In addition, they secure major public events, such as the basketball games, by searching for explosives in the area. #ATF #DogsOfInstagram #Working #Dogs #K9s #Police #LawEnforcement #Buffalo #NewYork
