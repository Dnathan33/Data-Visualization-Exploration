An exclusive picture from The Displacement Series by Wonuola Lawal - A policeman signals to stop a mother from Marina, Lagos crosses the road with her twins in New York City.  _  Throughout last week, we saw Lagos through the photographer's lens. Her work, though from a nostalgia and longing for home as a Nigerian living in the diaspora, has shown how Lagos can blend in yet stand out.  _  In our interview with her, we asked what excites her about Lagos, and she said: There's a certain vibe Lagos has that I can't explain. I can feel it in certain places like art galleries and spoken word events; I also feel it when I'm around Marina. I guess that's what excites me - being around people that share similar interests to me, and being around places that celebrate art and music, and the talent our generation has.  _  We hope you have enjoyed this feature as much as we have! If you haven't read our interview (which features more pictures) with her yet, you really should. It's POWER packed!  _  You should also check out her amazing projects on her Instagram page - @thephotographerscorner - and her website www.wonuolalawal.comðŸŽˆ
