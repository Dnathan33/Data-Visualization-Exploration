WHICH STRUT IS YOUR STRUT? 😏 . [foot mechanics] . There are 3 main types of foot strike and gait from a lateral/sagital plane perspective . One or the other 🚶🏻🚶🏻‍♀️can predispose you to ankle injuries or other issues up the chain such as knee, hip and low back. If the ankle is already going in one direction with walking, then adding speed or load will accentuate that fault . -Normal gait- foot starts in supination, is in neutral by mid stance and then slight pronates and then supinates on toe off 👣 . -Supinated gait- foot starts in supination and never pronates(lowering of arch) much throughout the gait . -Pronated gait- foot starts supinated, then as heel strikes the foot primates and goes far beyond neutral and pushes off pronated. This is often seen in people who walk with duck feet 🦆👣 . . Which gait are you? Let me know in the comments below and tag someone who walks funny😜, now that you know your gait patterns 😏 . #footstrike #walking #motion
