(these are my net calories!) eat when you're hungry! don't focus on a number. listen to your body. i was SO busy today... physically active since 3am!! my body was hungry. i ate until i was content and satisfied. back to my normal, caloric intake tomorrow! tomorrow will be a relaxed day for me. only 2 clients in the morning and then i have a doctor appointment (wellness check-up, routine bloodwork) 🙋🏻 #personaltraining #personaltrainer #longisland #nassau #suffolk #queens #NYC #newyork #offlinetraining #weightlossjourney #weightloss #loseweight #motivation #inspiration #health #healthy #eatclean #trainhard #GIRLboss #ceo #entrepreneur #smallbusiness
