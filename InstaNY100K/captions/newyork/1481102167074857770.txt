#ispywithmylittleeye 👀😎 another snazzy #ShearShare window decal featuring one of our first #salon hosts in #MountVernon, #NewYork! 🤗  Thank you for coming alongside us to help empower more #beauty and #barbering professionals 💇✂by allowing them to lease space on demand. As salon and #barbershop owners, you make money on empty chairs. . . and as stylists, they get to keep more money because they're only renting workspace when and where they need it! A total win-win for our industry! 😉 💆👌💃To learn more, visit www.shearshare.com.
