Progress Pics 📸  I'm the lightest I've been for a while but...not the leanest 🤔  Changes in the scales can be a number of things - muscle/fat/water/stored energy (glycogen) - we know if it's going down that the body will need to use stored energy and fat loss will occur but more weight loss doesn't mean more fat loss. Same in the other direction, if your weight is increasing you are storing more energy and this may help you build more muscle but more isn't better.  Use the number to assess/monitor progress and help you make better decisions and changes, not define it. Use other ways to monitor progress also like pics and measurements.  I've been doing more classes @barrysbootcamp 🏃🏾expending a lot of energy but I probably now need to invest more time in lifting either outside of classes or pick double floor on a couple of days.  #theprogram #lookgoodnaked #fitness #personaltraining #run #lift #intervals #hiit #strength #fitnessmotivation #nutrition #mealprep #mealplan #reicpes #fitnessfoods #lifestyle #healthyeating #newyork #results #barrys #barrysbootcamp
