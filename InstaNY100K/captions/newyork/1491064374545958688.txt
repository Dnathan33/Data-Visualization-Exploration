So happy I got to catch @eggslut while Chef Alvin Cailan was one of the featured chefs at @chefsclubcounter on Spring Street. Really, really liked this Fairfax--cage-free soft scrambled eggs and chives, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions and sriracha mayo in a brioche bun. (This sandwich is named after Fairfax, a strip home to streetwear brands like Supreme, where Eggslut started was originally parked.) #newyork
