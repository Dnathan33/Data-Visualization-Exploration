Bit of an alternative #medalmonday this morning...what's the quirkiest non medal finishers prize/trophy/award you've received?! 🏅 . For the @nycruns @thecocoaclassic 5 miler back in January our race prize was a wonderful mug of hot chocolate and a bagel! Definitely needed after 5 very snowy sub zero miles through Central Park! ❄️ . P.S There is no emoji for bagels, what is life? 😂 . . #asics #asicsrunning #asicsfrontrunner #asicsfrontrunneruk #womenrunning #inspiringwomenrunners #thisgirlcanrun #run #runner #running #runchat #ukrunchat #runnergirl #bbgrunner #nycruns #newyork #womenrunning #runrunrun #runninggirl #runnershigh #runnersworld #runnerslife #runnerscommunity #runnersofinstagram #runners #runnersofig
