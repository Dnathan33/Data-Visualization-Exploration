First time making jewelry. Jewelry workshop 101 w/ @wynee_g was soooo much fun! Definitely outside of my comfort zone and attention span. ðŸ¤£ I have an attention span of a nat. Total miracle I made a choker. Next thing to learn is knitting.... #newyork #newbeginnings #try #adventures #creative #artsy #art #brooklyn #nightlife #freedom #christian #bible #biblical #etsy #human #connection #love #intention #beads #choker #jewlery
