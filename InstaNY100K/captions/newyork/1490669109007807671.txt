"For 15 years now, we have lived here. Before that time, I was a pet of my master #Yoshi. When we were forced to come to #NewYork, I found myself for the first time without a home, wandering through sewers, scavaging for whatever I could find. And then, one day, I came upon a shattered glass jar and four baby #turtles." - #MasterSplinter 🐀🐢 #transformationtuesday
