The Untouchables (1987) "....But in the field, what? Part of a team. Teamwork.... Looks, throws, catches, hustles - part of one big team. Bats himself the live-long day, Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and so on. If his team don't field... what is he? You follow me? No one! Sunny day, the stands are full of fans. What does he have to say? "I'm goin' out there for myself. But... I get nowhere unless the team wins." - Al Capone  #ambition #business #philosophy #motivation #motivational #inspirational #inspiration #1930s #family #mafia #wealth #power #hardwork #publicenemy #theuntouchables #money #workethic #newyork #gangster #quote #respect #chicago #truth #godfather #alcapone #robertdeniro
