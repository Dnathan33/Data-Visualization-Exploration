Happy Tuesday! Here is a wonderful picture shared with us  by Ms. Mirta from her open class at PS 110! It's just as important to be able to pick out notes, chords, and recognize what they look like and their patterns both on and off the keys! Thank you for sharing this! ðŸŽ¹ http://pianoschoolofnyc.org #psny #psnyc #pianoschoolofnewyork #pianoschool #practice #pianolessons #musiclessons #grouppiano #grouplessons #newyorkpiano #newyorkmusiclessons #newyorkmusic #learnmusic #musiceducation  #youngmusicians #musicians #pianists #newyork #Newyorkpiano #newyorkmusicians  #skype #skypepiano #skypemusic #skypepianolessons #piano #music #playpiano #pianostudent #student #nyc
