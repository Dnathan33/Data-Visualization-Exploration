"I never understood before. I never knew what love was for. My heart was broke, my head was sore - What a feeling.  Tied up in ancient history, I didn't believe in destiny. I look up, you're standing next to me - What a feeling.  What a feeling in my soul - Love burns brighter than sunshine, Brighter than sunshine. Let the rain fall, I don't care. I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine. Suddenly, you're mine; And it's brighter than sunshine.  Love will remain a mystery, But give me your hand, and you will see. Your heart is keeping time with me.  I got a feeling in my soul. Love burns brighter than sunshine. It's brighter than sunshine. Let the rain fall, I don't care. I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine. Suddenly, you're mine. And it's brighter than sunshine." ~ Aqualung  #quote #music #lyrics #sunshine #love #heart #destiny #sunset #newyork #view #landscape #brooklyn #beautiful #picnic #wife #fun #delicious #life #kisses #photography #city #nyc #photooftheday #sun #instamood #cityscape #sunlight
