Today's #MLBPlayers411 is #NewYork #Yankees starting pitcher #MichaelPineda. • • • Did you know that before Michael Pineda wowed the majors with his incredible 2011 rookie pitching performance, he actually played shortstop? The #Seattle #Mariners converted Michael to pitcher when they signed him as a 16-year-old in 2005. When the Dominican Republic native broke into the big leagues in 2011, then-teammate #FelixHernandez became his mentor. “He (taught) me a lot. I learned a lot of things that had to do with being here in the major leagues. Dressing, how to take the bus, checking the board ... little things that I needed, he explained them to me,” Michael told NJ.com in 2015.  To read more about Michael, visit MLBPlayers.com.
