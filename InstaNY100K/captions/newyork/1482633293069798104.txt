Camp Arden's founder Herbert Carpenter and his lovely wife taking in the fresh air outside one of their platform tents. Circa 1880s. Later these platform tents would be converted into permanent buildings as the property evolved, as was typical of the great camps of the Adirondacks, New York. Today historic Camp Arden is home to Arden Creek Designs.  www.ardencreek.com .  #decor #design #customfurniture #furnituredesign #interiordesigner #interiorinspiration #interiordesign #camping #glamping #nature #history #homedecor #handmade #finefurniture #luxurydecor #lodgedecor #mountainlife #antiques #adirondacks #antiquephoto #newyork #tent
