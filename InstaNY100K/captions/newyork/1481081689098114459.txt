There's always an adventure in this buzzing city! One of our favourite things to do is take a long wander across the Brooklyn bridge. Although a very touristy thing to do, you'd be surprised to see many locals who go for a stroll. Maybe it's just the view of the skyline and water plus the crazy traffic beneath the bridge! .
