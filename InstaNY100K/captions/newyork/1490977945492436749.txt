FINALLY FINISHED: This piece took me into a completely different dimension; and had me face a lot of points of self in its creation. From aspects of love, hurt, happiness, and Pain elevation shows how it always glows in the mist of completion. Pacing on a name I deem this piece the name "Retrograde" this is a 48x36 original canvas painting. 👳🏾📿🐍👁🕴🏾👨🏾‍🎨🌊🏄🏾🌊 #x170konscioussociety #artwork #stars #kemet #space #art #spraypaint #spraypaintart #cltartist #charlotte #noda #artcollection #work #paint #dopeart #atlantaart #newyork #angel #africa #47thkhamber #supportblackart #blackart #blackartist #supportblackbusiness #selfmade #locs #loner #hippy #cosmos #galaxy
