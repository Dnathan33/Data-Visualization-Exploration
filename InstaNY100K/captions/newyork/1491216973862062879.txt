NEW YORK SKYLINE. This was commissioned a while ago. My style of architectural illustration, however they wanted a section of the Skyline true to life as it held something meaningful. This is  110 cm x 50 cm. It's the first time I've put a river in the foreground, but the boats really bring this piece to life and make it feel slightly animated. A high quality video will be put up asap #inkandpencils . . . . #newyork #nyc #ny #skyline #newyorkskyline #illustration #architecture #building #hudsonriver #boats #river #city #pen #drawing #draw #artist #art #graphics #design #designgraphics
