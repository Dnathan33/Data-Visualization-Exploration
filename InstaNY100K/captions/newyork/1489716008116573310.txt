Cyrille The Angel Transcends I hope They Can't picture This I hope They Can't understand This I hope They gonna let it Pass Let it pass.... Let it pass But I wish They Could see this I wish They can understand this I wish they gonna realise this Oh! Yah! Please save me Cause Im dying, Im dying I'm dying... I'm dying I wish, I wish I dream of Better Days I hope They Cant picture this Cause I walk with my Head High And Wish Ill become Stronger But My Wishes and Hopes Its all now Vanities Cause This Sorrow is Washing it away Away with My Strength in it From King of Sorrow by Sade featuring Cyrille The Angel #Sade #KingofSorrow #Music #Soul #PureSoul #Transcend #NeoSoul #Life #Love #UK #London #nigeria #Toronto #Canada #USA #NewYork #LA #america #latinamerica #africa #europe #asia #japan #tokyo #arts #artists
