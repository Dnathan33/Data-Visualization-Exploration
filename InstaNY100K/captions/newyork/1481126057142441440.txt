{Book 68 of 2017} "Affection is the mortal illness of lonely people." Gary Indiana's Horse Crazy is fundamentally about loving someone who's always walking ahead of you into an unreachable distance. Set in New York's gritty Lower East Side, it tells the story of a gay writer whose flattening adoration for a young, erratic, ex-heroin addicted artist named Gregory drives him to the brink of breakdown. As their unhinged relationship stumbles along, both find themselves edging into territories that might eventually end up swallowing them. As all that unfolds, the writer's ex-lover, Paul, lies in a hospital bed dying of AIDS. Indiana is one of those writers who portrays ugly things in beautiful ways and in Horse Crazy we're brought up close with the awfulness of jealousy, heartache, addiction, uncertainty, death, and terrible loss. This is a deeply sad, powerful novel that will leave you thinking about it long after you've read its final word. Recommended.
