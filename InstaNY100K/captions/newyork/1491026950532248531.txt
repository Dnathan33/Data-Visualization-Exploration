When I was in school my teachers called me stupid. Called me dumb. Told me I would never make it. You know how hard it is to love yourself when that's all you hear for years! . Luckily I said forget them💁🏻‍♂️! And was able to learn how to love myself more than ever before. I love life, I love you all, and let's make this year count. #makeitgreat #successmindset #itsyourtime #PHOKISHIPHOP #miami #newyork #losangles #chicago #houston #philadelphia #phoenix #sanantonio #sandiego #dallas #sanjose #cleveland #detroit #stlouis #baltimore #washingtondc
