My new favorite book store. I'm finding a lot of great little books here, including this fantastic one of photos by someone named Clovis Ferreira França called 'Territórios de afeto'. It's right near one of the buildings I have class in and I can't help by drop by every time. The guy there is really nice and chill. Doesn't do unnecessary small talk. Love it. . . . #books #photography #phonephotography #usedbooks #manhattan #newyork #nyc #newyorkuniversity #instagood #picoftheday #book #bookstore #reading #art
