‘Portable Art: A Project by Celia Forner’ opens at Hauser & Wirth New York, 69th St, on 20 April 2017 – an exhibition of wearable objects commissioned from fifteen artists with works that exist somewhere between sculpture and bodily adornment. Organised by @celyvent the Portable Art Project includes unique pieces as well as editioned series, crafted from an array of materials ranging from traditional gold and silver with precious and semi-precious gems, to enamel, aluminum, bronze, and iron. – Bharti Kher’s lion-headed ‘Warrior Bracelet’ (2016) is intended to both physically and emotionally transform the wearer. It is jewelry as talisman and protector; and by virtue of requiring the wearer to hold it in place via a concealed handle, it harkens to elements of performance. Kher has described this highly adorned gold-plated work as an empowering accessory, ‘a skin the shaman carries… Wear it to work and keep it in your bedroom for when you need to call into being your warrior.’ @bkherful – Image: Bharti Kher, Warrior Bracelet, 2017 Photo: Gorka Postigo @gorkapostigo  Model: Rossy de Palma @rossydpalma © Bharti Kher  Courtesy the artist and Hauser & Wirth – #BhartiKher #Warrior #Bracelet #Gold #Silver #PortableArt #HauserWirth #NewYork #NY
