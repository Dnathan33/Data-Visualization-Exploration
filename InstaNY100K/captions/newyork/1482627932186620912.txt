"Know the Power of Women in Leadership...She Makes a Difference" the plaque by her feet states. Meet #fearlessgirl - one #nyc 's hottest attractions and well deserved. What was supposed to be a temporary, commemorative salute to women in honor of #internationalwomensday commissioned by #statestreetglobaladvisors, may reside permanently within the sights of Wall Street's infamous Charging Bull. She's been granted another extension - until February 2018. Put her on your list of stops when visiting NYC. #formom #womensday #woman #women #empoweringwomen #empower #girlpower #yougogirl #gogirl #iamwoman #nyc #wallstreet #sculpture #art #newyork #iloveny #travel #wanderlust
