"Don't tell me I'm beautiful until you've seen the marks etched in my skin and the ones on the inside, on my heart, that I hide, don't tell me I'm strong until you've seen me break down, fall apart, time and time again, and cry until the tears no longer come. Don't tell me I'm a wonderful person, until I shut you out completely and I push you away because I promised myself that you are just like the rest and you'll get tired of me too. Don't tell me I'm lovely until you've seen what nights are like and the terror that sometimes posses me. Seen me sob and tremble and question "why me?" Until I run out of air and collapse. Don't tell me I'll get through this, that this only temporary until you've seen the inner torment inside of my mind and the demons that refuse to be silent. But if you've seen that other part of me. The scars, pain, insecurities, and bitterness that I hide. The voices that whisper during the day and scream during the night, and the darkness lurking behind my smile, and you still stay by my side, and think me truly beautiful, then.. maybe just maybe.. I believe you." #shadows#light#grandcentral#newyork#city#bloggerstyle#asthetics#blackandwhitephotography#photography#potd#travelphotography#vsocam#captures#photographer#simple#sunlight#instadaily#igersoftheday#tflersdaily#quotes#streetstyle#bloggerstyle#bloggers#instagrammers#concretjungle#dreams#wordstoliveby#pain#glory#art#tflersdaily#natgeotravel
