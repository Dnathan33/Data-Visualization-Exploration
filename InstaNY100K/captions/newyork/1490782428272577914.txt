@eterate.co on how she took a chance on developing a new skill on the side and opened up a world of possibilities. -"I've always enjoyed practicing modern calligraphy. To me, it is a therapeutic activity. In 2015, I attended a watercolor workshop at @_mamannyc_. I added some modern calligraphy finishing touches to my artwork & it caught the eye of the cafe owner. The owner requested for me to handwrite all her menu signboards, which are still being displayed at the cafe today. I wasn't an established modern calligrapher but I kept going. When I went back to my hometown, Singapore, I started accepting assignments & conducting workshop. After a live calligraphy for a beauty company, word spread online and referrals started pouring in." ✨✨ Check out her work on @eterate.co!
