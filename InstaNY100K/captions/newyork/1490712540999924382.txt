#Newsday article featuring my Brother/ Partner Michael Fernandes. 12 years ago we had nothing. We always said we would give back when we could. Although most of the work is done in silence, I wanted to share something that's been in the works for awhile. Miracle City. And for some, that's exactly what it will be. Any and all properties we held have been converted to serve #Veterans and individuals with #SpecialNeeds ..... #PSA #Instagram is not real life. People let you see what they want you to see. Know that and know the difference between what's real, and what's a mirage. Never give up, and always, ALWAYS try to make a difference! #NoGames #NewYorkCity #NewYork #motivation #Champions #GrownManShit #RealEstate #CRE #MakeADifference #NoGames #No #FakeNews #Boom #TEAMKO #BashBrothersTV #Live #Laugh #love #Vision #OrlandoAssetManagement #StewardProperties #NYC #Legacy
