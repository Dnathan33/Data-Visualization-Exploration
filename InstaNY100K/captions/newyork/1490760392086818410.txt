Whenever we walked in the room where Botanical Perfuming was being taught, it felt like you were getting a little whiff of heaven. The adorable @abaloveapothecary shared her brilliant knowledge to help her students create custom scents that evoked certain energies & the personal connections to it. We loved this thoughtful, soulful approach to perfuming! . @sweetpaulmagazine #sweetpaulmakerie2017 #sweetpaulmakerie #brooklyn #newyork #organic #natural #creative #creativity #crafting #craft #creativeretreat #perfumes #scents #handmade #botanical
