@runwaymagazines  @rolex  The Cellini Moonphase has a white lacquer dial with a blue enamelled disc at 6 o’clock showing the full moon and the new moon, the former depicted by a meteorite applique and the latter by a silver ring. The moonphase is read via the indicator set at 12 o’clock on the subdial, as the full moon and new moon rotate through the lunar cycle. #Rolex #CelliniMoonphase #Baselworld2017 For more details about this watch see the link in the profile.The Rolex Day-Date is a watch like no other.
