Bushwick, Brooklyn. Here we are at my friend's bar restaurant @saludbargrill that boasts of beautiful local art work, extensive draft beer selection from local breweries, with an interior handmade from pieces that were left at local demolition sites - ranging from the walls, the lighting to the chairs you're sitting on. And lastly delicious food. Salud! üçª
