Still crossing names of your list? Having gifters block? I tasked my team to create gift guides from their style, based on their home and fashion as I know that a lot of you identify with them. Today on the blog we‚Äôve got 2 sets of gift guides - @bradytolbert (my favorite, stylish, pulled together but a little rebellious editorial director/content producer) and then later @hellosaratramp (my favorite hard working, artistic and quirky graphic designer turned in-house photographer/professional gif-maker). Meanwhile that was me, 4 weeks ago, wondering how I was going to tell my 3 year old that he can‚Äôt touch these perfectly wrapped presents for 6 weeks and that when christmas morning does indeed arrive that  these are totally empty because they are just props for our ‚Äònever too early‚Äô holiday shoot. üì∑ @tessaneustadt #on3 #nordicinspiration #fashionblogger #decorationinspo #inspiration #decorating #homestyle #touchofcolor #photography #styling #nordichome #homesweethome #dekor #finahem #creative #interior9508 #hiasandinding #netherlands #postermurah #–ª–æ—Ñ—Ç #nancy #travelphotography #newyork #line #usa #–¥–∏–∑–∞–π–Ω #interiores #—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π–∫–∞ #eventoempresarial #paris
