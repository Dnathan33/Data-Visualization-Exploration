Like dancing in a chorus line in New York City, tonight's Improv X Holidays was a magical experience!  Thanks everyone for joining us at @cafedeuxsoleils for our comedy mashup show! Together we discovered Rapunzel's dark secret, had a hardcore haiku battle, and learned the true meaning of family!  We're back next week for Pop-Up Comedy Jam with special guest @patrickmaliha! Come join the fun!
