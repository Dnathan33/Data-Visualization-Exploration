One of the best moments in Santiago Calatrava's World Trade Center transportation hub exists between structural beams and the ceiling, and is seen by almost no one but for a few people who take a short escalator ride in one corner of the enormous complex. In this photograph, it appears cathedral-like, when in fact it is scarcely larger than the human body. still, I will take it above the others.  #calatrava #oculus #wtc #worldtradecenter #transportation #transport #transit #nyc #newyork #newyorkcity #newyorkthroughanarchitectslens #blackandwhite #blackandwhitephotography #bw #architecture #engineering
