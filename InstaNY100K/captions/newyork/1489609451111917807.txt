Jessica Chastain was rocking a ball cap today and of course her amazing personality in Central Park and I literally pondered for three hours whether or not I should do something about it. So I did. But then I was wracking my brain thinking how to caption this: "But where are all the women?" Or "How about them apples?" Or "Jessica, how do you want to caption this?" Or "Lets play a game of 'Where's Jessica'?" Either way, it was a fun way to exercise her new model. Stay tuned for weekly illustrations of zany and goofy Jessica doing zany and goofy Jessica things. Also Chaplin. #jessicachastain #illustration #illustrator #animator #dynamicdrawing #captionthis #centralpark #newyork #newyorkyankees #actress #personality
