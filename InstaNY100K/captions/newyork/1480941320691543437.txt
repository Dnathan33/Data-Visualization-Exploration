Today was a difficult day. My sister and I planned to go to this event before the passing of my father. We decided to go anyway and I'm glad we did. I didn't have much time to meet with @iisuperwomanii but she made me feel like she cared about how I felt. I appreciated that and that's why I'm a fan.
