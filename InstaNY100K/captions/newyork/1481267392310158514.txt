Thursday : We conclude our "Film Studies for All!" series with a #film once intended to be a #horror film. It succeeded. "Synecdoche, New York" (2008). We're doubly-honored to have Tom Noonan join us #live for a Skype, to help untwist this #cinematic gordian knot. Or at least try. For more details on the series visit www.shadowboxstudio.org. For more info on our ongoing #online film studies course, visit: www.modernschooloffilm.com -- or if you're in #northcarolina on Thursday, get to class! #movies #cinematography #love  #durm #durham #raleigh #cinema #screenplay #screenwriter #screenwriting #modern #classics #classic #shadows #knots #nyc #newyork #theater #acting #actors #doubles #actorslife
