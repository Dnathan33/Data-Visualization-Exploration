First visit to New York, upon leaving #bhphotovideo I see this man with an amazing camera, I step up to him and ask, " may I take your portrait?" A quick nod of the head, a quick adjustment, snap snap, a thank you, another nod of the head and I was on my way to finish visiting #Newyork.  Taken with my #fujifilm #x100t #35mm #streetphotography #streetphoto #oldschool #blackandwhite #nyc #portrait #fstoppers #photooftheday #life
