Friends in Canada and USA! I will be there sooooooon! I will be spending maximum time in Mississauga and Toronto (1-14th April) and in New York (24-30th April). I am sooooo excited to meet my husband @dhruvparpia after TWO LONG MONTHS, but I am also very excited and eager to meet the dance community there. Please let me know if anyone wants to organize a 1-2 day workshop or just meet up for a group practice session in either of these places. You can write to me at contact@nayantaraparpia.com ♢♢♢ [Photo from my solo performance at the Singapore Indian Fine Arts Society in 2013]
