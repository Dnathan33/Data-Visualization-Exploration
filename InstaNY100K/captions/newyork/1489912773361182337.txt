My yiayia (grandmother). This photo was from the late 80s I believe. Like many from her generation she was indestructable. She survived war, then more war, then genocide.  Survived being uprooted from her homeland, then poverty, then more war, then civil war. We all miss her. All I have to do is think of what she went through when I think I have problems.  #greekblogger #greekvegan #vegan #genocide #yiayia #oldphotos #grandmother #greece #pontos #pontiangenocide #newyork
