Okay, I travel a lot, like all over the place for work all the time. I survived the TSA short-staffed hour long wait in Chicago three times last year during the month of April. But I have never seen a shitshow like Newark airport right now. My sister's flight was canceled last night, mine is delayed this morning, the lines are absolutely insane and people are running around like it's the freaking apocalypse. God damn, New Jersey, no wonder I haven't been back here in 4 years...nice view though. #skyline #newyork #missyoueastcoast
