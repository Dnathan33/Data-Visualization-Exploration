Architecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton "architect", from ἀρχι- "chief" and τέκτων "builder") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements. @dailyoverview @flynyon #skyscapes#light#lightblue#night#years#ny#new#york#newyork#city#newyorkcity#life#nightlife#friday#architecture#scapers#follow4follow#beautiful#beautifulplace#amazingplace#photo#photography#photographer#photooftheday#fotografia#pictures
