I have a love/hate relationship with Mondays... . I LOVE the fresh start, new week feel... . But I have a HORRIBLE habit of going to bed super late on Sunday's that leaves me dragging all day! 😒 . So even after sleeping in a little extra, I got mentally prepared for the day and threw in a quick 15 minute workout just to get my body moving and my heart rate pumping! . Happy Monday Beauties! 👊🏼💕
