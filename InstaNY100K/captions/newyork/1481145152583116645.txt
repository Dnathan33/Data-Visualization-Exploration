Signs of Spring 🌷- everyone has their own opinion about what makes life in NYC tough: the crowds, the noise, the rent, what-have-you. But for me the toughest part these first 6 months has been the weather. Having lived in San Francisco for so long, I took nice weather for granted. I even had a fondness for @karlthefog 🌁 But in NY the seasons change daily and it's hard to know what to wear! I've lately come to think that I'll be able to consider myself a New Yorker once I've figured out which days to wear sandals and which ones to wear my parka. ☀️❄️
