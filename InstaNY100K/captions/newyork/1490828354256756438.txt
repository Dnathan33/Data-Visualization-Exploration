A bit of a messy photo from directly after our incredible performance at the Apollo. It's was honestly one of the most magnificent trips I've ever been on. Performing at the Apollo is an experience I'm sure I will never forget. I'm so thankful to everyone who helped us get there and made our trip so unforgettable. I'm glad to be back in Oregon but I miss New York and can't wait to visit again someday.ðŸŽ¤ðŸŒƒðŸ—½ #jazzchoir #family #apollo #newyork #harlem #nyc
