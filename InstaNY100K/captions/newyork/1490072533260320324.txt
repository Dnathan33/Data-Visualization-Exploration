Another location with a long history @montaukmanor was originally opened in 1927 by the same man responsible for the rise of #miami #beach #florida Carl Fisher. He wanted it to be the “most fabulous summer resort ever imagined in the western world”. The #manor had shut down, but it's been restored and reopened to it's former glory. Highly recommend a trip to the breathtaking #montauk #ny and staying at this #historic manor. . . #newyork #longisland #longislandsound #ocean #travel #explore #corkscrew #wine #vino
