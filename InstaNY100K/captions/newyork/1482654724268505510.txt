"It is New York's most beautiful city in the world? Maybe. No urban night is like the night in New York. I looked out over the city of skyscrapers. And that's when the big buildings lose their reality to replace it with magical powers, becoming so intangible that it is as if there were only lighted windows" #newyork #nyc #empirestatebuilding #topofempirestatebuilding #view #viewofnyc  #amazing #amazingview #manhattan #timessquare #night #lights #picoftheday #photooftheday #photography #instamoments #instamood #instagram
