Youth  I want to see you game, boys, I want to see you brave and manly, and I also want to see you gentle and tender.  Be practical as well as generous in your ideals. Keep your eyes on the stars and keep your feet on the ground.  Courage, hard work, self-mastery, and intelligent effort are all essential to successful life.  Character, in the long run, is the decisive factor in the life of an individual and of nations alike.  Theodore Roosevelt.
