Lolita quickly attained a classic status. Today it is regarded as one of the prime achievements in 20th century literature, though also among the most controversial. The novel was adapted into a film by Stanley Kubrick in 1962, and again in 1997 by Adrian Lyne. It has also been adapted several times for the stage and has been the subject of two operas, two ballets, and an acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful Broadway musical. Its assimilation into popular culture is such that the name "Lolita" has been used to imply that a young girl is sexually precocious.  newzealand  #beijing  #losangeles #lasvegas #poland #milan #hollywood #russiangirl  #warsawgirl  #polishgirl #девушка  #slovakgirls  #newyork #california #москва #buenosaires  #romaniangirls  #romaniangirls #moldaviangirl  #manhattan  #buenosaires  #czechgirl  #stockholm  #venezuela #munichgirl #california #acsessories #lolita  #copenhagen  #colombia #canada
