Apparently today is National Siblings Day! How fun! It's awesome to reminisce the days of living in Brooklyn, playing power rangers (sorry Nicole that we always made you be a guy ðŸ™ˆðŸ˜‚), imaginary friends, and Disney movies. The memories I have with my sisters are SO special.. I'm thankful for the few years we were together as kids. It was magic. âœ¨ðŸ’› And now that we are all grown up ((omg you guys are almost 25!!!)) we can still live magically... just more adult-ish. Haha. Love you girls. Triplets!! #nationalsiblingsday #twins #triplets #brooklyn #newyork #childhood #magic #90s #family #sisters #thanksjesus #apparentlyithoughtsomethingwasfunny
