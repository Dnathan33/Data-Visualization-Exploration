I've started making linocut prints and stationary art 4 years ago today. It has been amazing years in New York. Can't believe that I've been surviving in this competitive city jungle as an artist for 5 years. Especially wants to say thank you to @strayvintage for accepting my work so long! #daily #newyork #rosafulgarden #strayvintage #queens #brooklyn #stationary #printmaking
