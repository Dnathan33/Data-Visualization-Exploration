Fritz Koenig's "Sphere for Plaza Fountain", which for almost 30 years, took pride of place at the centre of the plaza at the foot of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Recovered from the rubble, damaged, yet somehow - essentially in tact - the 25 ton bronze sculpture has been here in Battery Park for 14 years as a temporary tribute, but will soon move to Liberty Park beside the World Trade Center.  #TheSphere #BatteryPark #FritzKoenig #sculpture #Sphere #globe #Art #Survival #WorldTradeCenter #WTC #Fountain #ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ #ðŸ—½ #NewYork #NY #NYC #Manhattan #NewYorkCity #NewYorkILoveYou #EmpireState #uniqueNewYork #NewYorker #NeverForget #neverforget911 #LowerManhattan #DowntownManhattan #BatteryPk #instaNewYork #instaNYC #instaManhattan
