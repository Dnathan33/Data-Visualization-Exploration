Walk your path, not the footsteps of another. Your path, your steps... Confidently. Walk with the head held high. eyes open. Aware. In the direction of your intention. You may detour,sidestep too. Sometimes you might feel lost. But you will be fine, feeling unsure and lost is part of your path. Don't avoid it, take a deep breath, keep the intention and you will find your way... 🙏🏼 #flexfriday 📸 @martygottlieb
