On Monday, we featured a Jimi Hendrix concert poster that sold very well in the latest Hake's Americana & Collectibles auction, so today we thought we'd share this historic concert poster for The Beatles at Shea Stadium that sold for $4,283 after some frenzied bidding from fans of The Beatles. While not as stunning visually as the Hendrix poster, this was the only poster to advertise the 1965 concert and only a few remaining examples are known. As such, they rarely come up for sale. #ComicWow #DiamondInternationalGalleries #PREVIEWSworld #Hakes220 #Hakes50 #vintage #collectible #Americana #Beatles #SheaStdium #NewYork #NYC #rock #concertposter #OverstreetGuideToCollectingConcertPosters #popculture #auction #results
