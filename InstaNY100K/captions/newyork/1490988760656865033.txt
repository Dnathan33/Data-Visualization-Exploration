Today 2 more students took part in our Snapchat Student Observership Program. This program was launched through our Snapchat account and allows students to spend time in our operating room and get exposure to Dr. Schulman and his team. This is not a program offered by any schools, hospitals, or any organization. It is offered exclusively to our Snapchat audience. We have received many hundreds of applications from students all over the world. . . . Dr. Schulman created this program to provide valuable educational experience and mentoring to students who wouldn't otherwise have access to a program like this. These are high school and college students who are considering pursuing a career in medicine. Today we welcomed Caroline from New Jersey and Adueris from the Dominican Republic ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡´. . . . Over the next few months, about 50 students will participate. It is an honor to be able to give back by helping the youth pursue their dreams. . . . To see Dr. Schulman perform his surgeries live, make sure to follow him on #snapchat (nycplasticsurg). To schedule your in-person consultation (in our NYC office) or a virtual consultation, call us at 212-289-1851. You can also see more information and before and after pics on our website (link in bio). . . .  #plasticsurgery #boardcertifiedplasticsurgeon #expert #bodybyschulman #bootybyschulman #mommymakeover #liposuction #tummytuck #breastimplants #breastlift #bbl #brazilianbuttlift #newyork #nyc #newjersey #dallas #miami #losangeles #chicago #atlanta #kimkardashian #khloekardashian #kyliejenner #getyours
