WINK!!!! This little trooper had a bunch of teeth pulled at the vet today and his discharge papers said "Max is such a sweetheart!" He's already purring and happy after a stressful day. His tongue hangs out of his mouth more now that he doesn't have his front teeth holding it back. We had to say goodbye to his goofy vampire fangs, but now we have a funnier tongue to replace it. He's also super high, still sleeping off the anesthesia. My good man.  #vampirecat #funnycat #captainmax #mymainman #cat #cats #catlady #catlover #catsofinstagram #blackcat #blackcats #blackcatsofinstagram #blackbeauty #tongue #wink #newyorknewyork #newyorkcity #newyork #nyc #brooklyn
