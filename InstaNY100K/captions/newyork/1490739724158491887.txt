Had an absolute blast seeing @bandstandbway last night! So thankful for this amazing show and the message it sends out to our military and veterans. Everybody go see this ASAP (and make sure to bring your cryin' tissues). Also grateful that I got to have a super classy roomie night with @cocobrady and that we could surprise @lauraosnes with a sneak attack @kristinmulligan FaceTime at the stage door - what an awesome way to start the week! 💃🏻🎙
