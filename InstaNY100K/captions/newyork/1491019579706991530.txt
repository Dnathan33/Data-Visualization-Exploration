"I think if you're an entrepreneur, you've got to dream big and then dream bigger," Howard Schultz - Today I spent the day at MariaDB's M17 conference in NY where I sit on their board. Their logo is a sea lion and the founders were the original guys who started MySQL. This is in their honor for their major achievements today. So proud of the  whole team. Congrats guys.
