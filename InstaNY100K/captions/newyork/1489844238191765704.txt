. What comes to mind from the image?  Modeling (observational learning) is the most fundamental way an individual learns. Most of our neurological connections are created before the age of 8, which is why creating a safe environment that also stimulates a child's mind is essential for a healthy mind. The image above is a representation of a typical circumstance that happens at school. Child A is in the background observing the incident and at the same time LEARNING what is appropriate and not appropriate. I would also like to add that consequences are a major component to learning. Child B was instantly redirected which allows a consequence to be directly associated with a behavior to take place, and child C can feel that he is in a safe environment. All of these are important components to learning.
