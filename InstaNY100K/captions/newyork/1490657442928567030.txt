One of the first models I ever shot. Back then I didn't know how to retouch so I hired someone for super cheap to do it. Lol. . . . Looking back at some of my older work I decided to do a Throwback portrait week. Here I post some images that bring me back to a time not so long ago. Where I can reflect on my skill level at the time. Reflect on some of the friends and strangers I've met. . . Canon in DC . . .
