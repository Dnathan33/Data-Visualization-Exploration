Hello my marvellous intriguing instafriends! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„ This time I just wanna give you a quote, to inspire all my creative friends ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’› "Now is not the time for bigots and racists. No time for sexists and homophobes. Now, more than ever, is the time for ARTISTS. Itâ€™s time for us to rise above and to create. To show humanity. To spread hope. We must prevent society from destroying itself, from losing its way. Now is the time for love." I hope you have an amazing day, spread the the love and make a difference in someone's life today! ðŸŒž . . . #ig_street #Picoftheday #Instadaily #Igers #_ig_photobox #Instago #Photo #Awesome #Instaphoto #Instagramers #Sites_of_newyork #mydocushot #newyorknewyork #Instalike #thebeautyofnyc #perfocal #resourcemag #newyork #nyc #newyorkcity #usa #america #instagramnyc #igersofnyc #visualsofny #newyork_ig #newyorkphoto #newyorker #newyorklife #unlimitednewyork
