Being in an apartment with 4 other 24 year olds is not easy. Constantly trying to avoid crappy food...not easy. Being in control? Not easy. . This weekend, I drank. A LOT. 🍻🍺🥂🍾 (all of those were consumed). I also ate. A LOT. 🍿🍫🍦🍜🧀🥖 (all of those were consumed). . However, I was conscious of what I ate and made good decisions. LOOK what I made. A quinoa, kale/Brussels sprout, cucumber and egg salad. It was delicious and the entire thing was 7 SP. Baby steps, as I always say. When you see that your small decisions can make an impact, eventually, you'll make great ones all the time. 😉☺️😉☺️😉☺️
