- What makes BioFit different? - 1. I only instruct resistance training. 2. Every session is completely private. Just you and the trainer.  3. Sessions are 30 minutes in length. - You may wonder how you can accomplish a meaningful  workout in 30 minutes - Well, once you remove the time spent switching songs on your phone, changing the weight on the machine, waiting 3 minutes between sets, waiting for a machine to be open, chatting between sets, etc... the time you spend actually exercising your body (and what your body can tolerate) is actually pretty low - BioFitNY.com - #fitness #gym #personaltraining #personaltrainer #saratogasprings #saratoga #cliftonpark #albany #ny #newyork #follow #fitfam #weightloss #nutrition #fit #instagram
