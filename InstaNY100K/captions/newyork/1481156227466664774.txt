Day 15 of the #lamfrecordchallenge - A record that you over-heard and can't listen to anymore. . Every Ramones evergreen. I didn't even had to spin this records myself; at countless nights in punk clubs and bars the inevitable moment would come: 1...2...3...4  #3chords again ... and again... Seriously, it was just too much. This situation plus the bands that would copy them made me bury them in a pet cemetary.  #theymightcomeback #fromthatcemetary #samebutdifferent  #heyholetsgo #heynoletsnotgo #overramoned #roadtoruin #newyork #punk #vinyl #vinylcollector #vinyljunkie #record #recordcollector
