Words can't express how proud I am of this gal! 15 months training together and she has come so far. Over the last couple months, Randi has given her nutrition such incredible discipline and she's heading into her wedding in the best shape ever. I'm thrilled to have been a part of your journey! @randieichenbaum For everyone out there who's seeking a personal trainer - At the end of the day, you can't just show up for the session and expect to see results. It's about the choices you make before and after your workout and your commitment to a new lifestyle. Fitness is NOT a destination, it's a way of life. #ProudTrainer
