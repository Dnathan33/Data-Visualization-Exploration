Wow it's been three years. Apologies for the spam. Found a bunch of portraits I took in Ghana! . . . Looking back at some of my older work I decided to do a Throwback portrait week. Here I post some images that bring me back to a time not so long ago. Where I can reflect on my skill level at the time. Reflect on some of the friends and strangers I've met. . . . Nikon in Ghana . . .
