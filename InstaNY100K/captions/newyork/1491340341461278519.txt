One thing I've gotten over recently is taking photos of other people and asking people to take their photo. It's a very awkward question, "do you mind if I take your photo?" And even more awkward is knowing when you don't have to ask, this is where things could go very wrong but I've had no bad experiences so far and no one has said no yet. My tip, strike up a conversation first, get on a good basis, then the person knows your intention of taking a photo isn't weird! I didn't ask these guys, but they were all smiling and looking at me, I was the only person the street not part of the parade so I figured they wouldn't mind. . . . . . . #bali #streetphotography #streetart #photography #사진 #landscape #travel #travelphotography #landscapephotography #urban  #여행에미치다 #travelblogger #blog #art #graphics #natgeo #bbctravel #canon #hongkong #여행스타그램 #wondersofourplanet #newyork #사랑 #london #travelgram #tokyo #nature #sunset #portrait
