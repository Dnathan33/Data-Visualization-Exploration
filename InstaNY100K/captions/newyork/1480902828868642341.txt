Exploring the endless #NewYork #food scene is a #beautiful thing... but sensory overload is REAL, #friends! My 5-day #adventure with my #California visitors was jam-packed with big #flavors, intense #aromas, and heavier than normal fare that left me with zero regrets, but a yearning for simple and #wholesome foods. My taste buds welcomed this #tasty #mealprep featuring #healthy #foods in their #natural forms: hard boiled #eggs, #nuts, cottage #cheese with #apple, #flaxseed and #cinnamon, and a #sweetpotato #edamame #chickpea #salad with ginger/#curry powder/cayenne/onion/#garlic/soy sauce 😊🏙🗽💪✈🌶🍄🍜🍽🍎 #rdtobe #fitfoodie
