Designer Patrick Kelly's Fall Winter 1986 "Button dress" (L) and my Lace Cape ensemble from Fall Winter 2012 (R), yesterday afternoon at the fantastic "Black Fashion Designers" exhibition at The Museum of The Fashion Institute of Technology in New York @museumatfit . Thrilled and honoured  to be in the entry gallery of this exhibition next to such an iconic and inspiring influence of mine as well as alongside many friends, colleagues and inspirations. This important and illuminating show, curated by Ariele Elia and Elizabeth Way, is up until May 16th. #patrickkelly #duroolowu #blackfashiondesigners #exhibition #themuseumatfit #newyork
