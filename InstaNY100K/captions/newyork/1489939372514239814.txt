Lay in a NY park with the sun on my face, bare feet, surrounded by others finding the same serenity amongst the insanity of the city. Also heard this thang opened yesterday. All my "Brooklyn" dreams are coming true hahah (watch the movie if you haven't omg). [I've now endured two winters in a row, and spring in NYC is apparently amazing.... Summer I've heard is kinda the worst] #newyork
