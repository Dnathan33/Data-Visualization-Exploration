This city is super easy to navigate. My preference is walking but when I need a ride cabs and über are my pick. I do both but in busy traffic, from remote locations and when with a group Über is an absolute must. It's easy, safe and available in most cities (even internationally). If you don't have it, download it now and make your travel easier. Here's a free ride code you can use to try it.
