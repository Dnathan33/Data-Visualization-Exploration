This is a very special #vintage jacket that I found in @beaconscloset #manhattan #newyork | The moment you wear it, it feels like you are going to a #ball or a jazz #dance show | it gave me so much surprise and #vintagemood | The #vintagebag I found in #vintageshop TOKYO7. All this #vintagestyle fits with a #bold #redlipstick | can't stop #loving it. . . . Back to the 70s :) . #bomberjacket#colorful#70s#70sfashion #photography#outfit##style#styles#fashion#girls#vintagefashion#fashionista#oldschool#50s#instadaily#photooftheday #photo#inspiration
