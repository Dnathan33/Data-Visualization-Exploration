Despite a loss to the Raptors, Knicks center Willy Hernangomez put together a huge game. He tied his career high with 24 points on 9/15 shooting and collected 1 triple, 11 rebounds, 5 assists, and 3 steals. Hernangomez has been impressive this year in his first season in New York and the Knicks would be smart to make him their long term starting center. How good can the frontcourt combination of Kristaps Porzingis and Willy Hernangomez become? Let me know what you think in the comments section. - Jacob Wayne  #newyork #ny #nyc #knicks #knickerbockers #newyorkknicks #nyknicks  @nba @nyknicks @nbaontnt @nbaonespn @nbatv @nbacanada
