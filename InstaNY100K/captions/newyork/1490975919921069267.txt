Did you know I sell more then just LipSense? 🤔  I just started to use climate control about a week and a half ago on my eczema. And I am 💥amazed💥 by my results. The eczema on my hand🖑 is completely gone and the eczema on my knees and elbows are almost gone! 😀  I have no self control 😂 when it comes to itching my eczema..... cause it feels so goooood!!! But I am being an adult and trying not to and climate control is helping me out 👍 haha  It is also is great for sun burns!🌞 Check out my friends results below. The first picture is her awful sun burn and the second is after one application of climate control!! And that's not it!!!! It's great for stretch marks, but bites, those little bumpy things on the back of your arms and skin elasticity!  So it's pretty much heaven in a bottle! 😇 . . . . . . . #new #heaven #soft #climate #control #senegence #love #longlastinglipcolor #eczema #newyork #Indiana #westvirginga #hereicomeforyou #skin #healthy #health #smile #sunburn #bugbite #softskin #Ohio #Maine #itch
