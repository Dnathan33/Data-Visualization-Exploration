Gave me so much inspiration for the following season.  He was damn near the first person rocking the "bald" cut in the NBA, averaged 20-10 for the Sonics b4 n we got him for the cheap fitting perfectly with the physical Knicks, played 1 whole season with us he was truly the  Pippen to Jordan for Patrick that throughout his peak days he lacked. A  proven scorer as well as physicality that Pippen lacked against him. A neutralizer, it never got more competitive between those two teams in their hey-day. BUT in the off season on September 11th 1992 he bolted for the Celtics thus Fucking up our chances of us winning a title, he wanted 3 years and we cudda shudda had at least one title if he gave us 3 more years and become immortal. We had such a Squad why leave???? Charles Smith under the basket, game 5 the next year I Alwayz reply in my mind "what if" it was the X-Man? smdh!!!!!!!
