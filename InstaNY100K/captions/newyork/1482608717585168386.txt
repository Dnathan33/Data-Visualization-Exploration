Today I'm driving down to Plymouth to attend a wedding, so in that spirit, and as the sun is shining, here's a shot from a wedding I shot in NYC last year. Ciara and Pete were dream clients, and I can honestly say that their wedding was the best one I've ever shot. Ceremony in Central Park, drinks on a rooftop bar overlooking the Empire State Building, dinner in an incredible restaurant. . This shot is from the taxi ride into Central Park, so that we could do some shots by Bethesda Fountain - and one of my favs. I like getting up close when I shoot documentary style, so I was in the front seat of the taxi, and they were in the back. A lovely day, and a fantastic memory. Have a great weekend everyone. . #wedding #party #weddingparty #Newyork #celebration #bride #groom #bridesmaids #happy #happiness #unforgettable #love #forever #weddingdress #weddinggown #weddingcake #family #smiles #together #ceremony #romance #marriage #weddingday #flowers #celebrate #instawed #instawedding #party #congrats #congratulations
