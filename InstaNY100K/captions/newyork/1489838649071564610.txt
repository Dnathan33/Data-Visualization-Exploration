SS Rex was built in Genoa in 1932 for the Italian Line and she had been the biggest italian vessel untill 1991. She won the Blue Riband in 1932, travelling on Genoa - New York route. During WWII she had been sent in Trieste, because it was tought to be a safer port than Genoa. However Rex had been bombarded in front of Isola d'Istria in 1944 by the British Air Force and sank. #rex #steamship #trieste #genoa #genova #istria #newyork #italy #italianstyle
