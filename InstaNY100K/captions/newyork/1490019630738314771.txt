If you haven't already make sure you check out the new episode of "GUESS THAT SNEAKER!" Game show. We blindfolded the contestants and gave them each a different sneaker and the first person to say the name of the shoe would get a point. The loser had to drink a nasty smoothie which consisted of some things such as Various Indian spices, olives and many more things. Please check it out and leave a like and a comment so we know your watching. Link in bio. Thanks!  Thumbnail - @gksgold
