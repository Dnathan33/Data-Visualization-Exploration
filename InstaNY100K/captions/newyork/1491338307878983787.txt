It's official yo. First ticket booked enroute back to the States. 86 days later I'm feeling ecstatic and more in alignment than ever. As much as I would love to live abroad forever, I know there's so much work my soul is calling me to do back in the U.S. Even though the idea of going back cringes me and certainly isn't going to be easy work as my soul has a big ass vision waiting & ready to be birthed. First priority is getting my dang teeth permanently fixed, yah know important things 🤤😜As much as I'd rather do it in Thailand, it feels better to head home to do the permanent work while being with family & friends. Not sure on exact dates of when & where I'll be but I will be jumping between NY, California, Hawaii, and Australia often. Watch this space 🦄 Epic Shit happenin'. Sending my love from Thailand ❤️
