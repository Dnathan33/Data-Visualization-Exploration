[Job Agency] A man standing outside of a job agency near East Broadway. 🙋🏻‍♂️ . "Chinatown has long had a dense infrastructure to help new immigrants and find their footing. Without leaving East Broadway, a fisherman fresh from a Chinese village could get a job in washing dishes in Arlington, VA...He could also find a bus to take him there, and an apartment to share with six other men from his hometown." -The New York Times. . Didn't know agencies still exist in Manhattan Chinatown. Surprisingly seeing agencies serving not only new Chinese immigrants but Nepalis, Mexicans, Indonesians, and Salvadorans. . However, from what I observed, agencies mostly offer jobs for men but not women. I guess essentially the job market for immigrants is still the same. . . . . . #immigrants #job #jobagency #chinatown #nyc #newyork #chinatownnyc #fujifilmxt10 #renee #history #vscocam #vsco #streets_vision #streetphotography #life #lensculture #tuesday #documentary #story
