"In life you can be dealt a winning hand of cards and you can find a way to lose, and you can be dealt a losing hand and find a way to win. True in art and true in life: you pretty much make your own destiny. If you are by nature an optimistic person, which I am, that puts you in a better position to be lucky in life." Here's looking at you Chuck Close. Thank you for creating art nearly every single day. You can find this gem at the 86th St station in NYC. #art #inspires #mosaic #slefportrait #subway #nyc #bigapple #newyork #purasoulphoto #purasoultravel
