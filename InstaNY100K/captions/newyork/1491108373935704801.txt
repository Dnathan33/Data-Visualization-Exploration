Our negative emotions/ feelings, thoughts are extremely dangerous viruses that override our so called common sense. We are engulfed in the thick layer of misery and self-pity. No matter how painful the experience there is that someone tells us that "we are where we are meant to be". We are told to have that "trust and leap of faith in the universe that everything is just fine". Soul of Sales - The Nine Universal Laws coming soon to you in the book Success Mastery. Rohit Bassi, our founder, is co-authoring the book with Jack Canfield. #jackcanfield #celebritybranding #business #success #inspiration #money #wealth #successful #influence #persuasion #london #linkedin #vietnam #dubai #newyork #singapore #hongkong #soul #love #life #spiritual #tonyrobbins #hanoi #hochiminhcity #haiphong #danang #cambodia #soulofsales #thailand #soulofsalesthenineuniversallaws @nicknanton @raiderang
