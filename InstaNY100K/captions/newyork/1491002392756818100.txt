Beautiful Pink Full Moon shining over the Fire Island lighthouse.  At the end of the day, full moons are essentially times of heightened energy and it all depends on how you channel that energy. You can either use it for nefarious purposes or you can put it towards bettering both your life and yourself.  #love #gratitude #longisland #fullmoon #newyork
