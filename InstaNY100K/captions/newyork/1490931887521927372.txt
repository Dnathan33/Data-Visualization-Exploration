I finally took a pic here. It’s where #MarilynMonroe lived in Brooklyn. I find it odd that no one (that I’ve met at least and seemingly anyone in general) knows this. I know I’ve read more about Marilyn than the average person, but still. I kind of like it though, somehow makes it more special. Something about her that isn’t exposed.
