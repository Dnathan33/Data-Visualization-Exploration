London / England / UK 🇬🇧⠀ ▪️Things to See⠀ ▫️Tower Bridge⠀ London was a thriving port in 1894 when elegant Tower Bridge was built. Designed to be raised to allow ships to pass, electricity has now taken over from the original steam and hydraulic engines. A lift leads up from the northern tower to the Tower Bridge Exhibition, where the story of its building is recounted within the upper walkway. You then walk down to the fascinating Victorian Engine Rooms, which powered the bridge lifts.⠀ (📷 : unknown)⠀ ⠀ #unitedkingdom #england #london #bigben⠀ #destinationswithguide #travel #vacation #instatravel #trip #miami #newyork #bangkok #paris #dubai #istanbul #singapore #seoul #hongkong #tokyo #barcelona #amsterdam #rome #milano #taipei #shanghai #prague #losangeles #dubai #toronto #moscow
