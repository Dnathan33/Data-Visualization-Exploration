Looking where to go this weekend, New York? No worries we got your back! Macy's hosting a flower show this week!  Folks flock to this floral-filled exhibition at Macy’s Herald Square, where jaw-dropping arrangements are on display for two weeks. The theme for this 43rd annual installment is “Carnival,” which means you can expect whimsical statues built with brightly hued blooms, which mimic the bedazzlement of a traveling road show.  #beapmkr #newyork #nyc
