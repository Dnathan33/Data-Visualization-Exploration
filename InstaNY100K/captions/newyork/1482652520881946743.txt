#Repost @magnumphotos with @repostapp ・・・ A new exhibition, taking place both in New York and online, explores the early days of Magnum in New York and the work created then. The exhibition portrays the workings of the organization and its community of enterprising members in dialogue with the city that has been Magnum Photos’ U.S. home, and a source of inspiration for its photographers, since its founding in 1947.  See the feature on Magnum today. Link in bio.  PHOTO: A Llama in Times Square. New York City.
