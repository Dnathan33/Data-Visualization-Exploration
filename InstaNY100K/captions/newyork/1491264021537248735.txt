"You need to be willing to eat shit, bleed, get laughed at, judged, snickered at, whispered behind,bet against, misunderstood ... If you believe in yourself and what you are doing and are acting like life is long and if you do the right things it's plays out then DO YOU ... I wish you heard and saw what people said about me from 1988-2003 ... I knew who I was and I was willing to be patient and work my face off to say "Now what assholes" .. stick it to the world if the world sleeps on you...BUT DO IT THE RIGHT WAY AND KNOW .. it's gonna be painful before it's amazing " - Gary Vee
