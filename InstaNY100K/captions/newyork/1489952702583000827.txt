The Frozen S'More is made off a special marshmallow, which is made by substituting honey for some of the sugar, so it has an unusual shiny texture. It's dense but super soft and not chewy, it melts in your mouth. Inside the squares are housemade vanilla custard that have been rolled in chocolate feuilletine (chocolate wafer cookie bits) that resembles a cookies and cream ice cream. Then it's torched to perfection to serve. However, it's a bit on the sweet side so I can't have too much of it. . Tag someone who would love this! üìç Dominique Ansel, NYC SoHo üíµ $7.0 .
