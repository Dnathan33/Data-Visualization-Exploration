Back in NYC! ☃️❄️The cold and rain added more drama to the already surreal impression made by the sound of flowing water in World Trade Center ground zero. Remembering the victims of 9/11. The heavens cry, too. What an experience! ☂️🇵🇭 #filipina #nyc #newyork #dramatic #unforgettable #travel #travelphotography #memories #fashion #winter #solotravel #USA #architecture #worldtradecenter #groundzero #adventure #rain #water #cityscapes #impressive #wintertrees #nature
