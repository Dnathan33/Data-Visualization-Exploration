After an insanely stressful week, I took some time for myself to flex my body and mind by working on my bind.  A great pose for opening the heart space, this is just what I needed 🙌🏼 Shoutout to @vigilante_yoga for providing a magnificent, calming place for women (and men!) to come together and empower one another 💪🏼 . . . #yoga #bind #yogabind #aerial #aerialyoga #aerialsilks #prana #vigilanteyoga #powerfulwomen #empoweringwomen #empowerment #strong #strongwomen #iphonephotography #whoruntheworld #GIRLS #watertown #ny #nny #newyork #upstate #northcountry
