We are thrilled to have partnered with @clarityjuice! Go give them a follow if you haven't already! #Repost @clarityjuice with @repostapp ・・・ Back in July of 2013, I gained the courage to launch my Clarity Juice "lemonade stand" at @saratogafarmersmarket and @spacityfarmersmarket. I started juicing at the farmers market with a @breville juicer and selling Clarity in ball jars. In August 2014, I launched the Clarity Juice cold-pressed juice line for the first time! I set a goal and didn't stop until I saw Clarity Juice bottles on the shelves of grocery stores. For the last two years, Brian and I with the help of numerous friends and family and AMAZING customers have helped spread the word about Clarity Juice! And today we go from coolers in the back of our cars to the real deal with a refrigerated van! We are so grateful to have partnered with the iconic Saratoga Spring Water Company. We are just getting started... . . . . .  #clarity #wellness #juice #juicing #healthyliving #health #coldpressedjuice #yummy #vegan #vegetarian #positivevibes #shinethrough #upstateny #saratogasprings #bewell #nyc #newyork #nycity #vsco  #fitspo #motivation #entrepreneur #huffpostfood #buzzfeedfood #yahoofood
