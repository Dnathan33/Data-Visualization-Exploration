This was just too beautiful not to share. During my walks too and from work, I always enjoy taking in all the sites. #NYC can be busy and crazy but some parts are undeniably gorgeous. Always take the scenic route and enjoy each day. God always has a way of showing us the right path but we have to listen. #godsincontrol #photooftheday #newyork #bryantpark #nofilter
