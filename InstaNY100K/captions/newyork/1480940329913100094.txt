Running w/ Purpose // Breathe Start with gratitude Remind yourself of your true identity Look up from current obstacles, to see the vision Take heart; letting joy fill your cup And keep striving forward "So I run with purpose in every step..." (1 Cor. 9:26) . “There are far, far better things ahead than any we leave behind.” – C.S. Lewis
