And we're done! For now at least! :) I wanted to show this off at the New York tattoo convention earlier this month, but they didn't really have any category that trash polka tattoos like this could fit into.  Bad planning from me there. No prices this year, and the level of theese artists is crazy high! :D i am so inspired and I am so happy for having the possibillity to go on this trip!  No limits tattoo convention was amazing, we had a great time and I got to freehand a horror doll face! And go to a casino! (Not legal in Norway) I also saw a t-rex dancing sexually on a stripping pole,  so I can die happy now.
