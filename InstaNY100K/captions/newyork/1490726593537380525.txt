I'll be honest - there's a point around this time every year when I believe that this day will never come; I tell myself that the the cold, grey days will go on endlessly, that the flowers will forget to bloom and the trees will just stay bare forever. And then like magic, there they all are: the warmth of the sun, the miraculous pop of color in a patch of dirt, the beginnings of new buds on the trees. Let this be a reminder me, to you, to whoever needs it: whatever it is we're going through, the endless cold, grayness of any situation is in fact not endless. One day there will be that miracle, that pop of color, that bloom. And of course, the beauty of it all is that that the cold will return, too. The question is: can we greet the cold, the warmth, the pain, the joy and embrace it all; can we understand that all of it is as necessary and impermanent as every single other moment of being in this world.
