On top of everything else that I'm doing for my career as an artist, I'm working with the girls of @d.n.a_danceofficial !! ✨💜 I'm excited to push myself and work with new people. Also... work on my album!! 🐶 follow them and follow me on my journey with them! And on my journey as an artist. ✨ a lot of things have fallen through with me and I didn't know if I should hang on to this anymore, but new opportunities always arise. So wish julia and I luck on our album as I make the "impossible" possible. And these girls and i luck in this competition🙏🏻 if you would go to the link in my bio and go like the video's that'd be great! I'm not in any yet, but I will be soon. 😈 sometimes I bite off more than I should, but I can always handle it. God doesn't give me anything I can't handle. : : : #newyorklivin #workingHard #chasingDreams #passion #dance #DNAOfficial #covergroup #kpopcovercontest #kpopcover #singer #artist #일상 #인스타그램데일리 #뉴욕 #NewYork #dancers #worthit #anythingispossible #trainee #talentedfriends #newadventures #NYC #kpopcoverworldfestival #2017 #instadaily #instadance
