Sometimes you meet your opponent just behind your back. With a big knife. Standing there and smiling. Deep inside you were expecting for it, but later it always comes as surprise.  You start thinking "why have I ever helped him/her/them?" And the answer is so simple. And you knew it. You are all human. But also you are so different. That is why it will be harder for you to get the best of you and move forward. And this will be the best way to kick the bastard's ass. #InspirationFromVA . . . . . . #odessa #upsidedown #beauty #life #inspiration #instagood #justdoit #dream #instagram #architecture #insideout #style #mood #ukraine #usa #sunnyday #happy #thoughts #creativityfound #empirestatebuilding #art #ideas #dreambig #usa #newyork #mood
