Because of this painting, we can consider #ElGreco to be the first landscaper in the history of Spanish art. Landscapes like 'View of Toledo' were quite rare among Spanish paintings of the Rennaissance and Baroque periods.  It is one of the best known depictions of the sky in Western art, along with #VincentvanGogh's Starry Night. This painting is on view at @metmuseum in New York.  #ElGreco died on this day in 1614.  #todayisartday #art #painting #oiloncanvas #elgreco #Toledo #Spain #masterpiece #sky #met #metropolitanmuseumofart #newyork #arthistory #renaissance #baroque
