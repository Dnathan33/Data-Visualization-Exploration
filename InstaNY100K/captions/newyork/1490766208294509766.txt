My brand new song/music video for "John Wick" will be releasing either this week or next week. I filmed the music video in New York City last week and am currently mixing the song. I'll start editing the video by tomorrow or Thursday. I might have the video ready this weekend (it will for sure be up no later than next Tuesday). I can't wait to share this super lyrical 16 bar track (which will be the intro to my next album). Thank you to all of you for your awesome support.  #InTheStudio #InTheLab #OnTheGrind #mixing #JohnWick #NewYork #ComingSoon #TheBoogeyMan #LyricalHipHop #HipHop #music #beats #artist #producer #skater #BeatMaker #MC #emcee #writer #lyrical #rhymes #InstaGood #InstaPhoto #BeastMode #CheckItOut #youtube #OnAndPoppin #DoubtMe #TheHyphenate
