working until 9pm tonight so I planned my snack & dinner ahead of time. I always like to keep my food simple and I sure do love grilled chicken!!! Day 2 of counting macros & I was smack on target!! Can't wait to see results from this method! Also, loving my new Food Network food scale which helps me accurately count and keep track of the food I eat! #bigresults #smallchanges #gymlife #gymworkout #hardwork #progress #planetfitness #health #healthy #healthjourney2017 #healthiswealthfitness #strong #fitfam #fitness #fitnessaccount #fitnessaccount #fitnessroutine #accountability #bbgjourney #bbg #bodypositive #bbgcommitment #bbgtransformation #bbgprogress #changeyourlife #changeisgood #goals #motivation #workoutmotivation #workouts #newyork
