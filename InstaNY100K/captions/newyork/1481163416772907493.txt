Most recent conversations about superhero films include either talk of Guardians of the Galaxy or Wonder Woman.  Spider-Man: Homecoming entered back into those with a big new trailer available yesterday online.  It reveals not only more about Robert Downey's role as Iron Man in the upcoming movie, but fans see even more of Vulture, played by Michael Keaton.  Sony and Marvel Studios also announced plans recently for more development into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with projects like Venom, Spider-Woman and Black Cat with Silver Sable.  Spider-Man: Homecoming hits theaters nationwide on July 7.  Pictured is the spot from the first Spider-Man on the lot at Warner Brothers where Kirsten Dunst and Tobey Maguire filmed what InStyle Magazine last year called one of the most iconic movie kissing scenes of all time.  Actress Marisa Tomei plays Aunt May once again in this upcoming movie, but captured an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for what film?
