AIPAD | We are in New York City at booth 426 at @aipadphoto until 2nd April!  From painted photographs and manorath paintings produced in the first half of the twentieth century to modern and contemporary works by Jyoti Bhatt, @moorederry, @waswoxwaswo and @basmeeuws we are presenting a range of works that loosely trace a rich and complex relationship between photography and painting in India. #tasveerarts #fineartphotography #vintageindia #paintedphotographs #manorath #jyotibhatt #derrymoore #waswoxwaswo #basmeeuws #newyork #aipad2017
