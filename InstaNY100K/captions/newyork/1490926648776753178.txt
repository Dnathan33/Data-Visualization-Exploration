A: Depending on the cause of your hair's change to gray, it is possible that the hair could revert to its natural pigmentation. If it is a case of genetics, the chance decreases, but in many cases where the change in haircolor is a result of illness, medications or stress-related issues, removing the cause results in the hair's color returning.  As for the option to use hair color to cover your gray, you should have no problems. As long as prior testing confirms that you aren't sensitive to the chemicals involved and therefore not likely to have an adverse reaction (and as long as the chemical service is performed properly) you should have no need to fear potential hair loss from a coloring service.  #askcharlie . . .
