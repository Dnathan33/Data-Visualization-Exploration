I hope to be able to share a photo of it soon. #art #painting #newyork #artist #fineart #peinture #portrait #child #studio #design #style #fashion #mode #kunst #interior #culture #expressionism #artcollector #artgallery #artfair #modernart #contemporaryart #igart #maler #drawing #illustration #pintura #dutch
