Ignore all you want but I wouldn't be doing my job as your friend if I didn't tell you about this. The Republican majority and backed Senate and House have voted to allow your/our internet service provider (Comcast, uverse, ATT, etc.) to sell our internet browsing history to the highest bidder without your permission. This means that everything you do online can be sold and used by anyone to do with however they please. This may seem harmless, but it is a bit of your privacy now being sold. Here are the individuals that have received funds from companies who gain from this reversal and are responsible for your sold privacy, and they are hard at work to allow these large corporations to sell more of your info for nothing more than to make a profit rather than look out for what is in the people's best interest, which is opposite of what a government should be. If you are against this and your state is listed below, I suggest you go out and vote to have these men and women removed from office. Or not... It's just a little piece of your privacy... #texas #newjersey #tennessee #louisiana #ohio #illinois #missouri #pennsylvania #indiana #california #northdakota #kentucky #newyork #florida #bigbrother #netneutrality #privacy #sowhatifigooglecatsplayingpiano #wannafightaboutit
