Update on Jenny Lee!! We are happy to report that Jenny Lee's loss of eye sight has completely reversed and she can see now - she has made a full recovery!  It looks like Jenny suffered from cataracts for a brief time at birth, which many times reverses itself. She was dumped at a high kill Texas shelter due to her condition. Today, Jenny Lee is the happiest 3 month old puppy. The only thing that could make her even happier is if she found a forever home!  Will you make her dream come true?
