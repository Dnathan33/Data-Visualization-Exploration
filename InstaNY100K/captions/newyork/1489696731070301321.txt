Dear you, don't toss and turn because you're thinking about the test you failed, the call you should've returned, the opportunity you missed, the person that you lied to or hurt, etc... don't you dare sit up there depriving yourself of sleep because of your obsession. Your obsession to beat yourself up by saying things like, "I'm not good enough." Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Tomorrow is another day to bounce back. Another day to recollect yourself. Breathe. Let it go. Sleep and bounce back tomorrow. ✌🏾
