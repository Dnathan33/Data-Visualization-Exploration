üçΩ A delicious experience at @NYUSkirball, "Cuisine & Confessions" by The 7 Fingers (Les 7 Doigts) is a must-see for food enthusiasts with an appetite for circus feats. By the end of the show, the audience is invited to taste the final course. üç≥ Not surprisingly, the idea was born in the kitchen. Co-founder and co-artistic director Shana Carroll tells us about it on Dance-Enthusiast.com. [The 7 Fingers's "Cuisine & Confessions."
