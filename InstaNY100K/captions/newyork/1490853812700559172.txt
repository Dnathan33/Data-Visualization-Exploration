ðŸŽ‚Quick #selfie from my shoot this weekend because I've had this smile on my face nonstop.. I just wanted to take a second to reflect on all of the love, kindness, affection and thoughtfulness I've received and on how amazing 27 was. I feel like I've grown as a woman, a human, a performer, taken on a new sense of confidence and had some pretty amazing experiences. I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to my fabulous 27 years, and especially to those who made this birthday truly a dream come true. From the shoot this weekend, the endless laughter, friendship, champagne flowing like it was water, to the greetings from old friends. I can't wait to see what happens in 28!
