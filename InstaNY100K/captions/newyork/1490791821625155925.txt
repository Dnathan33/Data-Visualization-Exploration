Breathe ☁️ . . . The architecture within the oculus of the One World Trade Centre reminds me of a rib cage, rising and collapsing with each deep inhalation and exhalation. Breathe... something I often forget to do when I am visiting this fast paced high energy city! Things are warming up out here! If any one is in town and looking to shoot or collaborate, I will be around for another week! #newyork . . . . . . #nyc #newyorkcity #oneworldtrade #photography #shootandshare #creatives #collaboration #nycartists #yogi #breathe #ribcage #architecture #deepbreath #city #photographysouls #photographymastered #nycphotographer #oculus #picoftheday #cntraveler #fpme
