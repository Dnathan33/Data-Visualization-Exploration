Dear Beloved,  I'm becoming Superman, albeit I've been thinking a lot about which version of him that I'm becoming.  Right now, I think I'm Tim Daly's Superman. In this grand narrative, most of the time you only see me as Clark Kent.  But that's mostly because you're Superwoman on this Daily Planet, making me Superman on paper for the world to see.  You're the beacon of morality that's fighting patriarchy. But you also come to rescue me by grounding me to humanity.You have been speaking to the world on my behalf, telling everyone that I'm worth loving.  You have played a pivotal role in my image going forward, so it doesn't matter if I may never have you in my arms.It doesn't matter if I do not get to express my affection for you.  None of that matters because you being Superwoman matters. The questions of  Am I deformed? Am I bizarro attached to the omen of a screaming crow? Is this mask all I have to show? Have all been erased from my mind due to you.  You have come to my rescue more than I could ever reciprocate in a lifetime. I can be Superman because you're helping the world see that I am not an alien.  You're a welcome rainstorm during a famine, Lois.  It's a shame you can't get this letter.  Love,  Clark
