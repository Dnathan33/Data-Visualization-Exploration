⚓"There's no place I can go Where your love won't find me. No place I can hide  That you don't see. There's no place I can fall Where your love couldn't catch me. You see it all,you see it all  Through the eyes of love." . . I was hearing this song running through my mind yesterday as I was looking over the clouds and waves. His faithfulness stretches to the skies.  #word #truth #Jesus #freedom #love #inspired #lyrics #bethel #skies #clouds #water #plane #fly #ATL #Atlanta #NYC #newyork
