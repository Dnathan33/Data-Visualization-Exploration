Rafael Montero has had a resurgent spring, and it has paid off for the once-heralded prospect, as he has landed a bullpen role on the 2017 Mets' Opening Day roster.  After struggling in the big leagues last season, Montero has put up staggering numbers to earn back a roster spot. In nine outings in the Grapefruit League, Montero has pitched to a 1.96 ERA while striking out 21 batters and holding opposing batters to a mere .209 batting average against.  One of Montero's largest problems last year were his walks and his inability to find the strike zone at times, which ended up costing the Mets some important games. But he seems to have cleaned that up a little bit this spring. Montero has walked eight batters in 18 1/3 innings. Last season, in just as many innings (19.0), Montero walked nearly twice as many (16). It'll be interesting to see who Montero beat out for a major league bullpen spot. Others Mets, such as Paul Sewald and Josh Smoker have had very solid springs as well.  It isn't inconceivable to think that Montero may get a few big league starts too. He has plenty of starting experience, and, especially considering last season, you never know what can happen -- injury wise -- to the Mets' rotation.  What do you think about Montero's promotion? Do you think he'll be a key cog in the bullpen this season? Sound off below!  #Mets #news #spring #Florida #NewYork #NYC #baseball #CitiField #LGM
