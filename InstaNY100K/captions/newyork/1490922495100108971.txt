Most people keep commenting on the pages of @KhloeKardashian and @KourtneyKardash but they don't check, read or ever reply to comments as they get thousands per post every second of every day.  _ Comment on the pages of their friends @ForeverMalika and @ForeverKhadijah instead as they don't get as many comments so they read them and often reply. Let them know it's 2017 not 10,000 BC. Let them know there's no excuse for animal abuse. Let them know that innocent terrified animals screamed, cried and suffered for their vanity ðŸ’”ðŸ˜’ .  _ Killing animals for fashion is one of the most heinous things our species is capable of and turning a blind eye is the worst thing we can do. If you ever see anyone wearing #fur, call them out on it. Never be silent. Keep fighting until every cage is empty.  _ Caption @a_lallie Photo #Repost @forevermalika
