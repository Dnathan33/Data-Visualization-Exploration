WHO LOVES FRIED CHICKEN 🍗?? I DO! I ordered the fried chicken sandwich because I was craving for it and saw that they had an interesting combination between the fried chicken, black bean puree, and avocado. I'm not usually one to get out of my comfort zone and risk my food (you feel me? 😂) but it turns out to be bombastic! Meadowsweet is probably my favorit michelin star restaurant by far. Super humble yet wallet friendly, great service, all of the dishes we ordered were delicious. . Tag someone who would love this! 📍 Meadowsweet, Brooklyn 💵 $16 .
