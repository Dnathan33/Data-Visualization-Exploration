"Macaroni" off of TBA ep, with the very artistic video by #wileyfilms, is my favourite song and is the most inspirational and deepest song from him, to me, even at this time in my life seeing that I'm planning to go away for a time and establish my own territory, with a future team hopefully, as an artist. It's so good I had to write to it myself lol. Anyway this sneakpeak is a portriat of him from the "still think about you" video directed by #kwazfraser that I wanted to finish in time and present it to him here in Orlando Fl. I will finish it though:).
