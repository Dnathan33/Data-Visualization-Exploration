Day 1355 / 4.66 M / 5595.10 RSM  I'm getting lots of messages saying how much my Colorado pix are missed.  Well I miss CO too. Bad. But I'm here now. I promise to try to take interesting pics when possible and to try and get around the city. Most of my shots, though, will be taken in Bay Ridge Brooklyn and my common back drop will likely be the Verrazano Bridge  as the mountains were in CO while the Shore Promenade appears to be my new Bear Creek Trail.  I will do my best. In the end though, it's about the streak and running. Even if I didn't have a phone for pix I'd still run.  Every Day. Every. Damn. Day.  Have an awesome day :-) #run #runner #runeveryday #runstreak #shorepromenade #ship #newyork #runnersofinstagram #instarunners  #runnercommunity #runningviews
