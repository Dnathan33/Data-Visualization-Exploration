Last night my wife and I went to drop off Han to the airport to go home and see her family in China for 2 weeks. She hasn't been home in over 8 months and is only 16 years old. I repeatedly tell her how brave she is. We told her we wanted to take her out to dinner before he airport and she told us about this local restaurant in East Islip- for some amazing Japanese food! . I have never seen a sushi 'bon bomb' before. This was so unique and absolutely delicious. I can't wait to show you what else we ordered- I'm literally dreaming about the food! . I can't wait to share with you about this local restaurant- and the pricing was so unbelievably fair. We didn't break the bank and the food was out of this world. . .
