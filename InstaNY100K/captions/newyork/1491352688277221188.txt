Doug Weight has officially been named head coach of the #Islanders. Through 40 games this season, Weight went 24-12-4 for a total of 52 points. Coaches that are available include Lindy Ruff, Daryl Sutter and Ken Hitchcock. Weight did a nice job of head coach, but don't be mistaken, there is still a lot of work to do. We'll see if Weight really has what it takes, or if this half season he had is the best it's going to get. UPDATE: More big news, per TSN's Bob McKenzie, all signs point to the Belmont site being the Isles long term home. He says to expect more on this in the coming days/weeks. Don't forget to DM us if you're interested in joining our bracket challenge! The league will be available shortly, hopefully. #isles #beLIeve #drivefor5 #newyork #newyorkcity #hockey #icehockey #ny #nyi #nyc #Brooklyn #barclays #BarclaysCenter
