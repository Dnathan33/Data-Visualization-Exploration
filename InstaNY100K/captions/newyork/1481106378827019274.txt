Exotic Spallina (double ravioli) pasta with squacquerone cheese, rabbit and saba. The food here is earthy, full of flavour and totally free of pretentious cooking. Seriously recommended if you're in SoHo NY. It's at 218 Lafayette St. #food #eat #foodie #foodheaven #foodaddict #delicious #mouthwatering #awesomefood #foodculture #yum #yummy #yummyinmytummy #america #newyork #travel #traveling #traveler #travelphotography #instatravel #travelgram #loveit #amazing #holiday  #break #getaway
