"One of the things that defines CrossFit SPOT is the concern and attention to each athlete’s personal health and well being. Each class begins with your coach asking if anyone has any previous injuries. If necessary, the movements are then modified to fit that individual’s needs. I suffered a shoulder injury last year. It put me on the sidelines for close to two months. I was a little bit intimidated to get back in and start lifting again. With the help of my coaches, I rebuilt my strength and confidence. I’m again now safely and comfortably able to perform all lifts and movements in all of the classes, and so I'm able to further progress." - CrossFit SPOT athlete Josh Liner (@joshualiner)  #SPOTwontSTOP • #crossfit #snatch #powersnatch #squatsnatch #crossfitspot #upperwestside #rx #metcon #amrap #wod #barbell #oly #olympicweightlifting #wodify #rogue #eleiko #nike #reebok #fitness #gym #workout #lincolnsquare #lincolncenter #newyork #newyorkcity #nyc #manhattan #gymnasty @crossfitaffiliates @thedavecastro @crossfit @crossfitgames @coachb.o.d
