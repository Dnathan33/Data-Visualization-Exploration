The view while in line at the box office for @rtc_nyc 's production of #ThePrice by #arthurmiller. While not a huge fan of the play itself, #dannydevito made up for it and the set design was stunning... got me wanting to go hunt for some antique furniture.  #nyc #newyork #broadway #theatre #vsco #vscocam #cityscape #skyscraper #city
