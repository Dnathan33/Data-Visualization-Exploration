💥 On a Tuesday 💥 --------------------------------- Suns out I'm out ☀️ --------------------------------- In reality, weather doesn't usually keep me inside, but when spring is finally arriving and it's sunny and warm out, I can guarantee you find me outside for sure. 😂 • And what better way than spending time with good friends and enjoying a nice and scenic walk over the Brooklyn Bridge with a spectacular view of Lower Manhattan? 😊 • I am so blessed and grateful that I can be outside and live in this amazing world and enjoy this city and everything it offers me. It's still surreal how amazing my life is and I cannot be thankful enough 😍 • What do you do when the weather is amazing outside? Let me know! 😋 • 📷 : lillsa & 📱 7+ --------------------------------- @keelyandniamh @newyork_instagram @newyork_ig @ig_nycity @ig_unitedstates_ @newyorktour @new_york_city_insta @nycprimeshot @nycprime_ladies @wander.nyc @best_of_nyc @icapture_nyc @loves_nyc @nycdailyfeatures @nyc_explorers
