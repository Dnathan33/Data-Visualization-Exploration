But let's talk about the art of communicating effectively for a bit...but first here's a story "UP UNTIL 5YEARS AGO,I WAS AN INTROVERT X 1000% -translated I WAS A CRYER ANYTIME I HAD TO SPEAK...WORDS HATED COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH" End Story  But the thing about holding inside what we dearly want to share kills our song.It imprisons us.And a piece of us dies everytime we remain silent  The art of communication is simple- JUST SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY!! And this means fully expressing yourself in your business,in your blogging,in person.Reaching out and creating a connection which not only removes us from our self made prisons,but shows the world your true purpose  So why are you still silent?Do you fear rejection?Do you fear being ignored?Or maybe you haven't warmed up your voice box as yet  Try it...breath deeply,relax and just sing.......
