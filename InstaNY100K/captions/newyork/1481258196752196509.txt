I demand honesty, respect and loyalty because I deserve it. I can give one person my loyalty to the end, I can love till my last breath, That's just who I am. I will never change because that what makes me,me no matter how bad life gets and if that make me difficult and a bad person then I rather stand alone, no one has ever question that about me.  #pastrychef#newyork#puppypower#pitbull#bluenose#love#happiness#barista#coffeeplease#fitnessjourney#workingonme#icandoit#30lbstogo#fighttilltheend#patience#paleo#ineedmyprotien#igotthis#iwontgiveup#strongheartedwoman#lordgivemestrength#ibelieveinme#fatbegone
