Thank you everyone for your prayers and support! My surgery yesterday went well! For those of you wondering what I'm talking about, I had both calves cut to give me more range of motion and hopefully solve some foot/leg/knee/back problems I was having. The surgery was 2.5 hrs long instead of 1 hour because I surprised the dr with how tight my muscles really were and gave him a run for his money. Luckily, there weren't any problems and I've got my awesome mama and bro taking care of me!
