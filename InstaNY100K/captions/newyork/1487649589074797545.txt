Here's a closeup of the patch work that we are doing on the sheathing. The first 2 feet above the foundation detail is a PT ply,  above that is 3/4" CDX filling In all patching for old rotted and odd thickness underpayment. We relocated all windows slightly to better the symmetry. Windows arrive on the 14th... hopefully the weather cooperates this week!!! @lobsterpants @megaman22 @chrismikeco #construction #contractors #contractorsofinsta #builder #built #residential #residentialconstruction #westchester #newyork #scarsdale #hardi #boral #walterwinchell #historical #woodframing #wood #advantec #plywood #patchwork #patches #gotham
