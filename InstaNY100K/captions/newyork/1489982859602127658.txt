Doors open at 1:15pm and fights start at 2:00pm. General admission tickets are $35 and can be purchased 3 ways;  1 - Go to the center and purchase them in advanced (they are open every day from 7am to 11pm) 2 - Purchase them the day of the fight  3 - Call and purchase them over the phone at 718-440-3358 and they will hold them for you to pick up the day of the fights.
