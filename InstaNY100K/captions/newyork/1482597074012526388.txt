#mystylephotochallenge #blue - a fabulous memory from this day in 2015 popped up on my Facebook wall this morning. It was an amazing family trip we took to New York 2 years ago, to celebrate Will's 18th birthday. This family selfie was snapped on the ferry going out from Manhattan to Liberty Island to see the Statue of Liberty up close and personal! Blue water, blue skies and blue scarf, coat and hat means I could fit it in for today's prompt I reckon! Fantastic memories of a wonderful trip and making me look forward even more to our next one to Orlando in 12 days time!! 💙✈️🇺🇸 #happymemories #smifftrips #newyork #thisisus #familytravel #familyfun #manhattan #makingmemories #familyselfie #facebookmemories #dontbeblueitsfriday #usa
