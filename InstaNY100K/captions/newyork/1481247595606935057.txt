. . Now there are many energetic creatures in my studio. They all have individualities and stories. I want to show you all my creatures and let you know original but real power that you also have. This time,  Two big artworks will be showed in Tokyo, four will be showed in Newyork, and the others, so many works will be showed in Shanghai. In future, I hope that many people in the world will get power from my original artworks. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 34th day for new canvases at my Gunma studio. . 21-24.4▶Art Expo Newyork / NYC 2-7.5▶SICF / Tokyo Summer▶Solo show at Modern Art Museum / Shanghai . #exhibition #当代艺术 #博物馆 #絵 #アート #現代アート #nature #Japan #color #artexpony #artexpo #artfairnyc #painting #artbasel #China #contemporaryart #abstractart #animal #shanghai #NY #NYC #nycart #artwork #museum #gallery #moma #artfair #NewYork #fashion
