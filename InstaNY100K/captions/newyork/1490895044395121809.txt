#tbt Andy Warhol and Ricky Powell in 1986, as shot by Lady Marmalade. Powell's organic photographic portraits feature all stripes of New Yorkers- from Grace Jones and the Beastie Boys to delivery men and joggers. In 1990 he put on and hosted a legendary public access show called "Rappin with the Rickster" where his focus was similarly broad- interviewing his famous party scene friends and inhabitants of Washington Square Park. A fixture in the downtown art scene for decades and a born and raised New Yorker, Powell's work is a living document of the cultural lifeblood of the city. He currently lives in the Village and has published four books. #tuesdayshoutouts #rappinwiththerickster #photography #photos #rickypowell #newyork #newyorkcity #andywarhol #art #artist #gracejones #beastieboys #washingtonsquare @thelazyhustler
