I can't believe I haven't read The Great Gatsby or watched the movie yet?!! But I am excited to read the book today and once I finish (hopefully I'll finish it today!) I'll watch the movie! The Great Gatsby has been on my mind for a really long time but I've just never gotten round to reading / watching it.. but since I've read Timeless and Timekeeper by Alexandra Monir (I'll post a photo soon!) I've been interested in Old New York and the 1920s~~ ðŸ‘—ðŸ‘ ðŸŽ©ðŸ’Ž #books #bookstagram #booklover #ireadbooks #ireadYA #thegreatgatsby #oldnewyork #1920s #5thave #manhatten #newyork #roaring20s
