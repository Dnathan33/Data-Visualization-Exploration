So New York has hit a roadblock with Bon Jovi cancelling but at least I've ticked one thing off my bucket list with my first Broadway show. @anastasiabway is incredible and I got to see my favourite West End performer, @raminkarimloo, smashing it on Broadway. ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ Time to go make the most of my time in this wonderful city with my family #newyork #nyc #broadway #theatre #holidays #travels #onceuponadecember
