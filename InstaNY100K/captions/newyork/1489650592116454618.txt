One of the things I like about New York is the history here, the mix of the old with the new. - The blend & contrast of the two has an incredible marble character & feel to the city that makes NY truly unique. - Thanks for the pic, @disney_marie_, it came out better than the one I was taking. ğŸ“¸ğŸ˜‚ğŸ˜˜
