Bonanno Snitch Gets No Jail Time Now a days you can't trust anyone. Niggas are snitching left to right. Even the most sacred of the sacreds. The organization that takes you through a ritual is not even safe. La Cosa Nostra, where one of the main commandments is, never be seen with cops, in other words, no snitching nigga, seems like everyone is flipping. I know I shouldn't say everyone, but damn, every time someone gets bagged they want to cooperate.  Joseph Gambina, 46, former Bonanno Crime Family Member joined the club out of fear that he was gonna get murdered by the family, after turning down a hit himself. The hit was for Randolph Pizzolo, which Mr. Gambina's cousin ended up taking and he made  sure to let the Feds know that.  As a result of his testimony, Joseph didn't do a day in prison.  #smuggling #drugdeals #hoodrich #gangster #mobrelated #cartel #organizedcrime #news #money #moneygetters #gogetter #mob #mobsters #breakingnews #mafia #mafioso #kingpin #ny #baller #bricks #connected #kelos #secretcompartments #getrich #getmoney #trap #bonanno #newyork
