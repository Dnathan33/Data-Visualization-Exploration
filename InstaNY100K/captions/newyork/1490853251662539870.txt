Speaker Spotlight: Danielle Chang, creator of @luckyricedotcom , created LUCKYRICE to follow her lofty, yet life-long, passion to create a platform for Asian culture. Her career has always revolved around pop culture, story telling, and entrepreneurship. Danielle began her career at The New York Times and later founded and published the lifestyle magazine, Simplycity.  After earning her Masters degree in Critical Theory from Columbia University, she was a Professor of Contemporary Art History as well as a curator of emerging art. Most recently, she was the CEO of Vivienne Tam, a fashion company and, prior to that, the Managing Director of Assouline, a French creative advertising agency. Instead of the visual arts, her focus today is the culinary arts, an appetizing and universal lens through which to share stories about our current obsession with Asian culture.  Danielle debuted her first cookbook Lucky Rice: Stories and Recipes from Night Markets, Feasts, and Family Tables (Clarkson Potter) on January 26, 2016. Lucky Rice brings alive the flavors of Asian Cuisine- from Japanese, Chinese, Thai, Korean, and beyond. Lushly photographed, this cookbook brings the fun and flavors of modern Asian cooking to the kitchen. Danielle is currently the host and producer of LUCKY CHOW, a national PBS series, which debuted in 2015 and is entering into its second season (national broadcast: April 2017). Meet Danielle at the 'Growing Your Event' panel in NYC, Friday May 12 at 10am. #festforums #luckyrice #newyork #conference #music #film #food #wine #beer #festivals
