Joakim Noah will undergo surgery on a torn left rotator cuff. He will need 4-6 months to fully recover.  Mind you, the Knicks singed this man to a 72MILLON dollar contract this offseason. Joakim still has to finish serving his suspension for drug use and recently undergone a knee scope.  Three years, 54MILLION left on his contract... #Mistake #WaiveJoakim
