Today makes 10 YEARS WE HAVE BEEN MARRIED...I wouldn't change you for the world. He is my soulmate and he understands my crazy ass. Being with this man is a dream they say if you make it past the first five years it's smooth sailing from there. Yea that's a lie lol ðŸ˜‚ marriage is about compromising and understanding... he always has my back and I always have his.... #happyanniversary  babe #marriage #married #black #blacklove #couplegoals #couples #fitmom #fit #fitgirl #fitness #bae #getfit #family #familygoals #brooklyn #newyork
