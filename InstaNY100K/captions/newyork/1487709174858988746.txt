For the next few photos I'm going to expound on a word and what it means to me, I've found that a word can mean so much to some and so little to others, words are almost living creatures in your mind, their food is your connection to it. I've always been  fascinated on how people think, so I would love to know what the words I talk about mean to you. The word for today is confidence: the boldness to step out where you haven't been before, the ability to think that no matter what happens, things will be alright in the end. #commuteforcreativity day 13 #fzeros #dof_addicts #depthoffield
