The Desi Jewelry “Pohela Boishakh” is knocking on our doors, this week. Being one of the most celebrated holidays in Bangladesh, it has us all excited about what to wear and where to go. This day surrounds us with colors and festivity, traditional to the core. A day dedicated to greeting Summer, the Bengali New Year sees people wearing lots of red and white, sporting flower crowns and of course, traditional accessories. This is the season to bring out your clay necklaces, wooden earrings and glass bangles. With the varying colors and intricate designs, these are the pieces to reach for, on this special day. To really express your inner Bengali, do a bit of shopping to match your jewelry with the saree or salwar kameez set you’re wearing. Keep in mind the heat and the Sun but also the art and culture that will surround you. In the true spirit of Boishakh, try to find colors that speak to you of a new year and new beginning.  #Lussotica #Dhaka #fashion #fashionindustry #fashionblogger #instablogger #instafashion #startup #jewelry #tiffanyandco #zara #womenswear #womensfashion #culture #bengali #Bangladesh #toronto #Stockholm #Waterloo #newyork #ontario #canada #usa #London
