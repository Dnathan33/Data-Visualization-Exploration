I know, I know.. Power Rangers?  Yeah, I saw it and I fricken liked it! Don't pretend like you don't wanna see it.. You do.. I know each and every one of you who are my age grew up with this series and we LOVED this shit. It was a nice throwback. They did a great job and it was very well put together. I'm not gonna babble on and on about how I liked it, all I'm gonna say is if you wanna take a small nostalgic trip back in time.. Go see it. Or you could see Beauty and the Beast which is also playing right across the hall. Wait, what year is this again?
