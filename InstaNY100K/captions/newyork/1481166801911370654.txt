I don't believe in scaring people straight.  I believe in telling them the truth. When the smoke clears and the streets really forget about you, there are some very important people that are forced to suffer along with you brother. If you are strong enough  I encourage you to put that b.s. down and look for another option. You can't replace time. #increaseyourdata #beforrealshawty #prisonisaprofit #prisonprevention #atriskyouth #solutions #realtalk #scaredstraight #facts #reality #truth #atlanta #newyork #la #vegas #houston #chicago #fn2s #wemanageanger â„¢@dainhenbutler
