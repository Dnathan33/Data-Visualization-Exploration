Lace closures and frontals make weaves looks more realistic without leave out. With a lace #closure, people can achieve a flawless weave and a #versatile parting. However, a lot of emphasis is placed on the part. Closures are ventilated strand by strand with a needle, pulled through and secured by a tiny knot. These knots are visible, and are often preferred bleached/lightened by the wearer. However, although there are pros to this method, pay attention to the cons. Bleaching the knots can damage the hairs on the frontal or closure, which eventually weaken the roots and lessen the durability of the lace.
