I think you have it wrong. I never saw it as running away. I saw it as an opportunity to make my dreams come through in spite of the challenges you have set upon me.

That's what kills you the most. • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • #ny #nyc #newyork #nyborn #tourist #washingtonsquarepark #travelny #iloveny #mood #nostalgia #park #nyparks #love #happiness #prose #life
