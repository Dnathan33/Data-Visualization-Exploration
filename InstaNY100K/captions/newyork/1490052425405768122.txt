Solin&Blanca wants to share with you real woman! We are tired of those fake images and fake perfection because there is no such thing like perfection but at the same time everybody is perfect. We want to share with you real woman, real beauties, real strong and natural woman, real story's. Like her: @comptonsveryown_  Amanda Ramirez represents power and beauty! She is such an inspiration. And you should tell all your daughters to look up to this amazing woman. Let her be the example for your daughters and for yourself. She shares her story and her positive energy with us while she got cancer treatment. Amanda thank god, we and our next generation have woman like you who we can look up to. We love you! Once she said in an interview 'My faith has grown immensely through my experience with cancer and I'm so grateful for all that God has blessed me with' #proudwoman #godblessyou
