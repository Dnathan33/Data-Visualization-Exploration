In 1999, the great American singer and painter, Tony Bennett, and his wife Susan Benedetto, a public school teacher, were inspired to start a public high school for young artists. They dreamt of a school that would integrate the arts with rigorous academics, require a commitment to community service, and help students cultivate a lifelong love of, and dedication to, their artistic passions and crafts.  #newyork #queens #franksinatra #tonybennett
