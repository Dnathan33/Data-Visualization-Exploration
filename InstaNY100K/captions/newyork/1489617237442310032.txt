One of the cool things about #treasuremarket is that the donations can come in the oldest, coolest, most fascinating boxes and/or packaging. This cardboard box was heavily worn, but what a gorgeous pattern, no? I ❤ it and its floral pink silver foil qualities. Happy end of Sunday and have a happy new floral pink silver foil kind of week. 😘 #treasures of #treasuremarket #boxes #rule #ny #nyc #newyork
