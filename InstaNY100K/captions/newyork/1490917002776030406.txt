"Gentrification and inequality are the direct outgrowths of the re-colonization of the city by the affluent and the advantaged," affirms Richard Florida, as he describes the new urban crisis facing our country.  He elaborates the outlook of "urban pessimists": "...the urban pessimists see modern cities as being carved into gilded and virtually gated areas for conspicuous consumption by the super-rich with vast stretches of poverty and disadvantage for the masses nearby. Urban revitalization, in the pessimistsâ€™ view, is driven by rapacious capitalists who profit by rebuilding some neighborhoods and running others down. Global urbanization is being foisted on the world by an unrelenting neoliberal capitalist order, and its defining feature is not progress and economic development, but slums, along with an economic, humanitarian, and ecological crisis of staggering proportions."
