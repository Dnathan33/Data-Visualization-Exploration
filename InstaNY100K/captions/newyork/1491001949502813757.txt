Playing tomorrow night with @thebettertones from 7pm-10pm at @fabbricanyc in Williamsburg/Brooklyn. This will be a great warm up for our show at Rockwood Music Hall on the 17th. We have relearned a lot of songs and arrangements we wrote a long time ago when we first started playing gigs around NYC specially for this show. We will also play a few jazz standards our own way and as usual, hang with everyone after we are done playing. So if you happen to be around Williamsburg tomorrow, come hang with us at Fabbrica, my friends. Special thanks to @frea_king for the invite! 😀❤🎸🎸👍🎶 #thebettertones #show #tomorrow #fabbrica #williamsburg #brooklyn #3hoursoffun #thankful #jam #improv #worldmusic #warmup #songs #arrangements #newyork #come #artist #guitar #duo #instrumental #love #loveformusic #music #livemusic #musicianlife #workhard #entertainment #play #instamusic #getready
