I take Lyft, Uber and Via everyday.  Via is a better company! This happened to me few times this week so I have to say something. Drivers either passed by me to force me to cancel so they charge me cancellation fee. This guy is the worst. Pressed he was at location but never showed up. Not only make me wait in the rain I had to pay for the fare even I'm not in his car. There's many good hardworking drivers out there. Shame on those bad scam artists drivers.  Please share this to shame on bad drivers! #lyft #uber #via #taxi #carservice #apps #triedofbullshit #bullshit #conartist #scamartist #scam #newyork #newyorkcity
