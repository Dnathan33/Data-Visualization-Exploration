The Blue Jays have claimed OF Ty Kelly off waivers after the Mets designated the Outfielder to create a roster spot for Paul Sewald. Kelly, 28, batted .241 in 71 plate appearances for the Mets in 2016 and struck out in his Only at bat as a Met in 2017. Kelly has been optioned to Toronto's Triple A affiliate and will provide outfield depth to the Blue Jays after their release of OF Melvin Upton Jr. Thank you @tykelly11 for your time in New York and best of luck to you in Toronto! #LGM #Tykelly #mets #mlb #bluejays #toronto #newyork
