(Chapter 21) -I ran home and went inside the house. The gang was sitting around the table playing cards. "Have you seen Kay?!" I asked frantically. "She's not here." Said TwoBit. "Is everything alright?" Asked Darry. I ran out the door before I could answer Darry, even if I wanted to answer him. I ran over to Kay's apartment. Hopefully she'd be there. I knocked on the door and no one answered. I turned to leave, but then I heard someone crying from inside. "Kay! Is that you?!" I called. "Go away Sodapop!" She replied. "Let me in Kay!" "No!" She cried. "Come on!!!" I screamed. She finally opened the door. "What's wrong?" I asked. "It's nothing..." She said quietly. "Why did you leave me at the clinic then?!" Kay started to cry more. "Because I didn't want you to see me like this Sodapop!" She pointed at herself. The tears streaming down her face. "What's wrong with that? I've seen you cry before!" "You don't understand! This is different! I thought the abortion would be good for me, and it was, but I feel guilty and I can't take it anymore!" She sat down and cried in her hands. I sat down too but she suddenly got up and went to her bedroom. I followed her and saw her take down a suitcase from her closet. "No! Where are you going?!" I yelled. "Home. I can't live here anymore!" She took clothes from her dresser and closet and stuffed them into her bag. She zipped it up and that was apparently all she needed, then she walked to the door. She ran down the hallway and outside, I had to run after her. "YOUR HOME IS HERE KAY! IN TULSA! WITH US, THE GANG!" I yelled. "I'm going back to New York!" I caught up to her and turned her around. "Please stay here, with me!" I said. "Too much has happened here Soda. I wish I could stay, but I really can't! I need to go back home." She pulled away from my reach and started to walk to the bus station. I called after her, "BUT I LOVE YOU!!!" She turned around again. "What?!" "I love you Kay!" I ran up to her again. "I've loved you from the start...when fricking Pony hit you with the truck...I've wanted you to be with me! Not Two or Dally! Me!!!" A tear slipped from my eye. "No. I can't Sodapop-" She started to say. (MIC!!!)
