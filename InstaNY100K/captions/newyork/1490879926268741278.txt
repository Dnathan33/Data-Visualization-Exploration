If you gotta draw a line between work, learning and fun in your life you're already doing it wrong. Many people I know think that learning ends with a degree and it's ultimate use is getting a job, as well as a job is just something mandatory to make money. Money that they'll use totally irresponsibly because they're "entitled" to "have some fun" after all that "work". I think you can see where this is going. Focus on what you're good at and keep improving yourself in that field. Never stop learning, and never stop having fun 🔥✌🏻
