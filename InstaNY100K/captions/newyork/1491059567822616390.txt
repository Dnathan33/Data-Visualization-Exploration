ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ IG: @jahkusto JAHKUSTO IS INFLUENCE MOSTLY BY CONSCIOUS LYRICAL GOOD MUSIC. LIKE BOB MARLEY, TUPAC, PRINCE, GOODIE MOB, OUTKAST, WU TANG CLAN, AND ETC. THE MUSIC OF JAHKUSTO IS BASE AROUND REAL LIFE EVENTS & LIFE EXPERIENCES. JAHKUSTO IS THE VOICE OF THE UNDERDOG WITH A STYLE OF MUSIC THAT'S SPIRITUALLY MOTIVATED WITH A SHARP LYRICAL NON BIAS SOUND.  JAHKUSTO'S BACKGROUND IS GENERATED FROM A MULTI-CULTURAL UP BRINGING. HE GREW UP FAIRLY BALANCE AND OPENED MINDED. HIS FAMILY IS FROM HAITI. SO HAITIAN, SPANISH, HIPHOP, AND DIFFERENT GENRES OF MUSIC, HELP JAHKUSTO TO BE FREE CREATIVELY.. HIS IDEA OF LIFE IS NOT NECESSARILY DEPENDENT SOLEY ON MUSIC, BUT ALSO FROM HIS PAIN, STRUGGLES, AND HARDSHIPS.  WHAT SETS JAHKUSTO APART HE HAS A WAY TO SMOOTH OUT CONTRADICTIONS THRU HIS MUSIC. HE TAKES THE STREET CONTRADICTIONS & RELIGION CONTRADICTIONS AND JOIN THEM TOGETHER WITH A SOLUTION THAT MAY HELP OUR MIS-UNDERSTANDINGS. JAHKUSTO ALSO SHOOTS, DIRECT, AND EDITS HIS OWN MUSIC VIDEOS... JAHKUSTO'S FUTUREÂ  HE IS MOST PASSIONATE ABOUT HIS VISIONS AND CREATIVITY. (TRAIL BLAZIER) EVERYTHING HE TOUCHES WILL TURN TO GOLD.
