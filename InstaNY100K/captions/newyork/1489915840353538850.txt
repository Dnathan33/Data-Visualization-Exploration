🙏🏼My "altar" (aka Meditation Station). When I first started meditating there was a buzz about making an altar, a collection of spiritual or special things in one area of the house that you would sit in from of and connect to during your daily mediation practice. So, instead of running out and buying incense that makes me sneeze and pics of hottest gurus on the block, I collected a couple of MY happy times memorabilia: The first 🎍plant I haven't killed in under 3months, a shell 🐚from the beach in Zanzibar post my Kilimanjaro hike, my first of a zillion salt 💡lamps, sage 🌾for removing bad juju and a baseball ⚾️signed by Big Papi (If you don't know, you definitely should know). I'm sure it will grow but for now, thazzzzit. Make your altar mean something to youuuuuu. If you couldn't pick the Buddha out of a police lineup he shouldn't be in there. 😜 #doyou #mediation #mondaymotivation #happyhouse
