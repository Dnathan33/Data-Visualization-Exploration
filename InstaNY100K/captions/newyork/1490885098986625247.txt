How to take care of yourself & reap further benefits after an acupuncture session 📌🙏🏼📌 24 hours after a treatment is as crucial as the treatment itself. Ensure to rest, apply heat packs & engage in healthy practices. This will leave you with a greater sense of mental clarity, as well as improved physical vitality... 📌Take it easy: rest & relaxation are essential following acupuncture. Some patients do experience a sudden boost in energy after a session, it is best not to expel this energy but to rest as this will enhance the physical and emotional restoration process 📌Avoid caffeine & alcohol: The body is in a fragile state after treatment and putting toxic substance such as alcohol can quickly affect the body and energetics and potentially undo the positive effects of the treatment. 📌Avoid ice & cold treatments: Cold restricts energy & blood flow. Not only does cold halt progress, it can actually cause further pain. Instead use heat packs to ease pain. 📌Try and feel the treatment unfold: close your eyes and feel the sensations running throughout your body. Doing that will add more 'qi' and energy flow to further enhance treatment. 'Where the mind goes, energy flows' 📌Breathe: breathing enhances results because when you move the breathe, you move energy throughout your system. If you hold your breathe, energy stops flowing. 📌Drink warm water or warm herbal tea: the body tends to use up a lot of water during a treatment to assist in the healing process. Warm water allows the body to absorb liquids quickly and efficiently bringing it back to an ideal state. 📌Be gentle with yourself and don't expect miracles from one treatment: repetitive treatments are necessary, not to say miracles can and have happened - The body takes time to re-adjust itself to new patterns and new ways of being. The longer the condition has been present, the longer the body will take to adjust. Healing takes time so be patient, your body is unraveling to a state of 'balance' after each treatment 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼
