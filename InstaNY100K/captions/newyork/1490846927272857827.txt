To the wonderful man on the NYC subway. A thousand thank yous for carrying my huge suitcase that I was schlepping through the city up BOTH sets of subway stairs. After which you turned around and carried a struggling mothers stroller back down to the platform. The women of NYC love and thank you!!!!
