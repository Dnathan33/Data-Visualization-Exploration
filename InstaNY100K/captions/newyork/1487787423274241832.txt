@Regrann from @bloombergbusiness -  The Senate is expected to confirm Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court later.  It'll end more than a year of high-stakes political maneuvering to fill the vacancy created by the death of Antonin Scalia.  On average, Supreme Court justices are serving longer tenures now than at any point in history.  That means a president's pick could influence the highest U.S. court for decades.  #WashingtonDC #NewYork #NewYorkCity #NYC #Manhattan #USA #America #American #DonaldTrump #Trump #work #job #career #money #rich #wealth #power #success #boss #motivation #inspire #inspiration #inspirational #business #politics #old #history #design #city #travel
