I'll train hard until the day my shoes hang over the telephone wire! It's in me. I'm an athlete at heart. I may have my moments of normality, we all do. But I never let it define me or control me. I make the rules for my life. I wake up with training on my mind, not because I'm obsessed with the gym, because I'm an ATHLETE! I don't train to look better than anyone, get ready for a show, or look good on social media. I train because that's what athletes do, we TRAIN! I'm asked by people all the time about becoming a @1stphorm athlete, and my first answer is usually, "Be an Athlete 1st, before you acquire to become a 1st Phorm Athlete." That statement holds true for anything anyone wants to try and become. Make sure you're already living that lifestyle before you expect anything from anyone else. How you see yourself BEFORE you become what it is you want to become will play a major role in the success or failure of that dream. For myself, I consider myself a lifetime athlete, and my life is filled with the daily rituals to produce that standard I set for myself years ago. What about you? What's your standard? How do you see yourself?!! ðŸ’¯ #iam1stphorm @1stphorm #GoHard365 ðŸ“¸ @nene_cramutola
