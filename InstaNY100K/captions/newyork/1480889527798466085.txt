Cost: £24.99 Rating: cash💵  @iconic.london has slayed my face once again. These high pigmented babies are worth every penny. I'll be honest... I got 4.0 and on my skin tone it was supper 🍊on my skin, but 0.1 literally is the most amazing color on me. And can we talk about the coverageeee? No such thing as bad skin with a swipe of this stick. Whether I'm using it as a highlighter or for full face coverage I am so in love with these pigment sticks.
