This 🐌 crushed a 10k and then went right to @swervefitness and won about 90% of the sprints. Why be human when you can be @senglish90? [Alternative Caption]: I got up early on a Sunday to watch Sam run through some mud and horse 💩except I didn't even really because he was so fast that I zoned out too early while he was crossing the finish line 😒. Nevertheless - dude, you are a inspiration and make me work harder every single day. Now go take a fucking rest day. #BEASTMODE #UAEHealthyKidney10k • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • #fitness #spin #spinning #cycle #cycling #schwinn #sweaty #sosweaty #bike #biking #swerve #newyork #newyorkcity #exercise #fitgram #fitstagram #instafit #instahealthy #running #run #workout #getfit #inspo #inspiration #friends #fitfam #slay #instahealth
