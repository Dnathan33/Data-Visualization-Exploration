RIP to my pops the legendary "Don Blackman". Master musician, composer, writer, and the best farther a son could ever ask for. Whenever I needed someone to talk to, you were there. Every time I gave you a ring, you picked up. When I needed advise, You always had the best solutions. Thank you for blessing me with your musical gifts, endless laughs/jokes, wisdom, knowledge, and most of all, always showing me unconditional Love. 😎🙌🏾🎼🎹 Be on the look out for new Don Blackman music this summer. 🎼  #donblackman #kyleblackman #ireneblackman #blackmanalbum #1982 #rip #funk #soul #jazz #gospel #rock #jamaicafunk #jamaicaqueens #farther #newyork #ledgend #classic #vynil #positivity #album #ｍasterpiece #love #insparation
