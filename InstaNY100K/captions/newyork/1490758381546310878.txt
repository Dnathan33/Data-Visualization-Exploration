#Repost @djteri with @repostapp ・・・ As promised, I'm replying to your questions. And the first topic is the dj I would love to collab or perform with.  My answer is always the same, it's one and only @skrillex . I'm sure a lot of you are sharing this love towards him as well. I was always inspired by his music, his performance and the fact that he is 2 steps ahead of any other producers. And couple of years back in Amsterdam I went to Owsla session and at the end of it I knew that I'm forever and ever in love with him. Sometimes you love somebody for his/her work and create a delusional picture of your idol, but in reality his or her personality or attitude can be quite otherwise. But with Skrillex it was 10 out of 10. The way he spoke, the way he expressed his point of view on life was so real and inspiring that it was a sealed deal for me. I'm very happy to have a person I look up to cuz sometimes during my lows Im listening to his music, watching his videos  and thinking that GIVING UP IS NEVER AN OPTION and I push harder towards my dreams. Inspiration and motivation can be found in different ways, and sometimes it's a person that you look up to. And hope the day will come and we will share the stage together. What about you? Who inspires you and helps you to make it trough hard times or get motivated? photo by inspirational @crevixa
