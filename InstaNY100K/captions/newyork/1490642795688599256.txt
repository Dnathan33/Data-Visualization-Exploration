Morning, fasting 80. As mentioned yesterday I need a break from eggs + wasn't too hungry waking up, so made myself a vegan blueberry smoothie and a piece of toast with avocado medley tomatoes and meredith goat cheese. I went to a @purebarrenyc class last night and really worked on my legs bum and core... feeling great today! #gestationaldiabetes #healthyeating #eatwell #whatiateforbreakfast #newyork #fitpregnancy
