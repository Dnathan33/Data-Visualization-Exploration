"A heart of stone, a smoking gun I can give you life, I can take it away A heart of stone, a smoking gun I'm working it out Why'd you feel so underrated? Why'd you feel so negated? Turning away from the light Becoming adult Turning into my soul I wanted to bite not destroy To feel her underneath Turning into the light" #blocparty #banquet #manhattan #ny #nyc #newyork #newyorkcity #newyorknewyork #manhattan
