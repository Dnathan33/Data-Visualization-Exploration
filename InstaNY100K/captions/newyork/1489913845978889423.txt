In beautiful New York to visit Hans prospective college, Fordham.  Dined at one of Restaurateur, Dave DeRossi's 15 meat centric restaurants of which he is turning all 15 of his restaurants vegan.  He made the switch after connecting his dog as being the same to all animals, and for the environment.  The food and ambiance was amazing.  So many vegan restaurants in New York!  So happy to be here, have a beautiful day!  Much Love your way. ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️🌱🌱💚💚💚 #vegan #vegans #vegansofinstagram #veganrestaurants #newyork #whatveganseat
