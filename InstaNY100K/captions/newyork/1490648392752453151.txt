Hitting Chelsea Market at the "sweet spot" hour just before the crowds came rolling in for lunch. Deciding where to eat was the hardest choice in this old factory turned food and shopping hall. I chose the lobster rolls at the Lobster Place (👌🏻), the rest of my family chose sushi and Italian.  After indulging ourselves, this was a great spot to climb up to the famous Highline Park for a walk with the best views of New York City! Such a fun city! . . . . #chelseamarket #meatpackingdistrictnyc #newyork #newyorkcity #newyorkcityfood #foodies #highlinenyc #wheretoeatinnyc #travelmom #familytravel #travelmum #exploretheworld #usa #familyvacation #familyholiday #travelwithme #travelwithkids #wonderful_places #vacation #lobsterroll
