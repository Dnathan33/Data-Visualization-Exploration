#mondaymotivation - Spring weather is finally coming to NYC, thank goodness 🙏🏼. The sunshine puts me in a great mood and there are nothing but happy positive vibes over on my side. Ready to kill this week ahead of me and make things happen! Who's on board?! 👋🏼 On a side note I think it's time to get me some fresh white @adidas boosts..destroyed these in the fall/winter 😑😭 some spring cleaning of my closet/kicks is long overdue
