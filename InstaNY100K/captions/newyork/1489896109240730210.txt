Good morning and Happy Monday, everyone! Giving a special shout to my siblings today for National Siblings Day! Give your brothers and sisters a call today and let them know you love them.  Next month will be two years since we lost my older brother, and these next few weeks bring up a lot of good memories as well as anger/sadness from still missing him. But today, I'm focusing on the happy memories and letting my older sister and younger brother know I love them. Have a great day, everyone!
