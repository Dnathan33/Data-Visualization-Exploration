To that time my school took us to Ghana to donate books and other resources to this school. Can't remember the names but the faces were beautiful. Being surrounded by all these beautiful African children and people was just Amazing. I can't wait to go back to Africa. One of the best places on Earth. . . . Looking back at some of my older work I decided to do a Throwback portrait week. Here I post some images that bring me back to a time not so long ago. Where I can reflect on my skill level at the time. Reflect on some of the friends and strangers I've met. . . . Nikon in Ghana . . .
