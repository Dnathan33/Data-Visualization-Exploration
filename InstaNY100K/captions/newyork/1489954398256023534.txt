April 10th marks the 100th day of the year. For our #mondaymotivation, we encourage YOU to keep pushing. Whatever goal you may strive for, whatever obstacle you may be facing. Push through it because no one else is going to do it for you. We’ve already made it 100 days into 2017. “The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.” - Eleanor Roosevelt #BubbleForChange #EndInDifference #Repost @magnumphotos Photo by @brucedavidsonphoto . . .
