Come join the #party! ðŸŽ‰ (Link to tickets in bio: http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/2891092) ABOUT THE PLAY Is love just a habit we want to create as an answer to loneliness? Or is it a real encounter with ourselves and the other? Porcupine looks at what we, human beings, strive for and the painful, sometimes pathetic quests we set ourselves on as we deal with the absurdity of false hopes and our attempts at pushing away a fate that repeats itself endlessly.  WHEN May 11-13, 18-20, 2017 Thursday-Saturday @ 7:30pm  WHERE Actors Fund Arts Center 160 Schermerhorn St, Brooklyn, NY 11201  MORE INFO: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/porcupine-us-premiere#/ #ny #nyc #newyorkcity #usa #us #art #actor #actress #performance #play #actorsfund #fundraiser #theatre #theater #brooklyn #sellout #soldout #comedy #darkcomedy #drama #dramedy #love #potd #spreadtheword #spring #indiegogo
