I'm en route from the crazy streets of New York - where I was honoured to introduce Sir Ran Fiennes to the sell-out crowd at @the_explorers_club annual dinner - to the Arctic Ocean. From the quintessential concrete jungle to a place that is 5m square miles of water and ice with no permanent structures. It's hard to imagine the huge impact cities like these have on the Arctic ice. It's also hard to imagine that what goes on in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic... The effects of climate change and the melting ice is detrimental to all of us.  #MRHxNorthPole2017 #NorthPole #climatechange #newyork #newyorkcity #travel #travelphotography #adventure #adventurephotography #instagood #instadaily #potd #picoftheday #passionpassport #openmyworld #yourshotphotographer #explore #justgo #mytinyatlas #travelgram #instatravel #beautifuldestinations #worldtravelbook #theoutbound #martinhartley #latergram #ventureout #ecad2017 #climatechangeisreal
