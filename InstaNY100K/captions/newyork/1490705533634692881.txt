#HappySiblingsDay to my #Bro Kenny! CashKen is always by my side, he is my ride or die, and it's been crazy watching you grow up man. I can't believe your about to make the journey to college, I remember pulling you out of our dad Pathfinder the first day you came home and hearing you laugh in my arms. They say 10 years is a lot for us to be separated by but nothing can be further from the truth. Love you much bro and I'll always be here for you. #Bruthas #Brother #RideOrDie #MyBlood #Koraju #Brooklyn #BrooklynBrothers #ThoseGBBoiz #NewYork #NY #InstaLike #Instalove #Instadaily #Memories
