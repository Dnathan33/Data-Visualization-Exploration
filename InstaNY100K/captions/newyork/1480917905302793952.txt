Real-deal Jewish sour pickles at Pickle Guys on the Lower East Side. Al "Your Pal" learned how to make proper sour pickles at the famed Gus' Pickles while Gus was still running the joint. And while most pickle places make their pickles in a few hours, these guys do an open barrel ferment over THREE MONTHS! This is worth its weight in gold.
