Coach Ben McAdoo has recently stated that he believes that Geno Smith will be Eli's eventual replacement. This is probably the scariest thing that I've ever heard McAdoo say. If you've ever seen Geno Smith play, you'd know why this is such a cringe worthy statement. When Eli is gone, we need to groom another QB that we selected in either the 1st or 2nd round. I know that Geno was pretty good at West Virginia, and maybe perhaps the Jets offensive system just wasn't for him. I don't know how comfortable I am with the Giants attempting to turn a Jets failure into a starting QB. This statement by McAdoo leaves a huge level of uncertainty and instability for our future at QB. Do you guys think that McAdoo is out of his mind, or that he's really on to something? #nygiants #giantspride #paradise #nfl #giantsfootball #giantsfans #nyg #newyork #geno #westvirginia #newjersey
