Is de blasio to blame for attracting the homeless to flock to NYC with his progressive welfare state ideology? When De Blasio was elected, he immediately set about removing barriers established to discourage people from coming into the shelters in the first place. His ‚Äúno questions asked‚Äù approach of "come and get it" is attracting individuals from out of state.  The city‚Äôs homeless shelters are a last resort for many New Yorkers, but they‚Äôre attracting an increasing number of people from out of town. New York City is also one of the lone municipalities that has a right-to-shelter law, which guarantees ‚Äî with only a few exceptions ‚Äî access to taxpayer-funded accommodations.  Roughly 1 in 6 adult couples and 1 in 10 families with kids who enter the shelters gave a previous address from outside the five boroughs, records show. As of the first half of fiscal 2015, that figure was on pace to double, according to Department of Homeless Services data. ‚ÄúThe huge social-service cuts and economic constraints we‚Äôve seen in the rest of the country mean we‚Äôre a pretty good place to come for a lot of reasons,‚Äù said Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, who first noticed the upswing.
