Has been a week or so, want to say how blessed I am to have you in my life. Things seem to be rough, but that's because where in the middle of the storm. I won't let you fall, sink or give up. We will make it, when we do I will share my world with you and help you get where you want to be. Thank you for being so sweet,  caring and loving me for me! Couldn't ask for anyone but you,  thank you sweetheart for being my best friend,  partner in crime and my lover.  #bestfriends  no one will #breakus #love is love. Amen!
