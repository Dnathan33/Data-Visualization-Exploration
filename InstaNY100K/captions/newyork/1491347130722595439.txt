The latest lesson in my life has been about control. There is actually so little we as individuals have any control over. Not being able to catch a train due to an accident last night? Out of my control. How I react was within my control. I chose to slow down and soak in the streets that I usually take for granted. So glad I did. ðŸ™‚
