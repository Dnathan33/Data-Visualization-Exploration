YAY! 👋🏼🏙 It's been a wild few weeks but I'm happy to say... Mike and I are BACK IN NY! I can't explain it - but it just feels so right. My parents came to help out and we all went out to dinner. Saw this AMAZING mural and looked at the name - @andaluztheartist  I know you!! Straight talent coming out of #WWHS 🙌🏼
