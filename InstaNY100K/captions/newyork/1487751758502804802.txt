Today is a weird day. I'm not sure of the words I'm  searching for. I feel like I am being robbed of the significance of today. Today is Piper's 3rd Birthday and I think it is fully now hitting me that she is gone. Piper passed away on Tuesday afternoon and I'm not sure how to deliver the news in any other way.  To say she is my best friend is an understatement.  She has been my most loyal sidekick, drowning me in the most beautiful unconditional love. She is  so kind, smart, beautiful, sassy, and wise beyond comprehension . She loved sleeping on her back in what looked like the most uncomfortable positions and always had her head on my chest when she knew I needed it most. Her love for fetch was overwhelming at times and she never was the one to end the game. I've never seen someone make people fall in love with them faster. She never let her massive Instagram following go to her head:):) She loved watching Friends and danced when you scratched her butt. Her tail broke many things with its strong wag, and I never cared because how can I be upset by pure happiness. She is the best thing and as much as I feel robbed that her presence here was unexpectedly cut so short I am learning to be grateful for the time she was here and all the things she taught me. When you love someone, you realize to some extent how strong that love is. It’s not until they are gone that you realize just how much of an impact they had on your life. It’s not until previously insignificant things start bringing back memories that you notice how much you miss them. It’s not until they are no longer around that you can see just how much of a void they filled.  Thank you so much to every person who loved her. If there is anything I am sure of is that I know she knew how much she was loved. Thank you to those who have been helping me go through this the last few days. I am so grateful.  Happy Birthday my beautiful Piper. I hope your soul is at peace somewhere over the Rainbow Bridge.
