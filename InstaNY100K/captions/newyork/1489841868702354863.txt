New York Mythic Exhibition wall shot. The notion of time and space has always fascinated me. particularly in the context of my cityscapes series. In both these images from New York Mythic on now in New York you can see the many layers of marks and reworking still visible in these finished works. This pentimento,changes,regrets,and edits are to me a reflection of the city itself. The medium of Drypoint allows such a great opportunity to create this type of expressive imagery. I hope my Drypoint where capture the same things that are going in these cities and in particular, New York with its many ghosts of buildings past still visible throughout the modern metropolis. With Drypoint I find the process and the the subject become one.
