Made it to Midway but not without 25 minutes of complaining from my Lyft driver. "I live in Schaumburg, why couldn't you have flown from O'Hare...?" Oh, sorry dude. Lemme rebook that flight real quick for ya ðŸ˜’. On the bright side, in 2 short hours I'll be exploring New York City for the first time! 8 days of nothing but photography. Game on!
