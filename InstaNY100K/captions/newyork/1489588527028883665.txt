🌞🌺🌸🍃 At it's best, life is happening right in front of you. The experiences will never repeat themselves,conversations are unfiltered and authentic, but if we are too busy staring down at our screen, we’re going to miss all of it and we will never be able to recreate any of it. Today, that was the reason why I decided to put away my phone and unplug from social media for a few hours to enjoy this gorgeous spring day with my dear friend @suzanasjenicic .We need to start paying attention and have more eye-to-eye conversations with the people in front of us instead of spending time looking down on our phones and keeping up with everybody who's not in front of us. Maybe that will help us improve not only our communication/social skills but our relationships as well. #mindfulmhc_ .  #selfcare #lawofattraction #spirituality #friends #mentalhealth #wellness #mind #newyork # #socialmedia #inspiration #universe #spring #centralpark #beautiful #life #technology #photooftheday #instaphoto #instadaily #sunday #fun #therapy #summertime #friendship #qualitytime
