There are two ways to get to Bish Bash Falls, pictured here by @neilbennett3. One is a one-mile hike starting from the Massachusetts side, and the other is a 1.5-mile trek starting in New York State. If youâ€™ve ever been to this 60-foot waterfall, which way did you travel? #goeast #newyork #massachusetts
