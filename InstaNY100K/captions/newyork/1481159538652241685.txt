Doing nice things for nice people is a simple gesture.  Today is the Prinicpal at my schools birthday and the kids are celebrating with a surprise birthday party in our room for her. Not only does the kids deserve it and need it but it's going to be fun to have he principal be surprised by some kids she often see in her office. What better way to see them in a different light. Everyone has a light but it dims either when we let it or allow other people to dim our light. Let your light Shine today. You are meant for greatness! A small gesture can go a long way today be the light! #surprise #totd #school #education #wisdom #success #successquotes #mentor #therapist #counselor #teacher #youth #kids #workshops #seminars #philly #philadelphia #arkansas #newjersey #delaware #newyork #entrepreneur #entrepreneurlifestyle #womanpreneur #womanpower #werknaorganizing #blog #bloggerstyle
