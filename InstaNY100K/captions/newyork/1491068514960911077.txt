I don't just dress well, dance around, and write cool thoughts, sometimes I act. 5 Women. One Bar. All truth. A lot of alcohol. My next project that I'm in  is #Bitchdrinks  come out and show your support the first two weekends in May, dates and showtimes are on the flyer. Save the date, bring a friend, and be prepared to consume all that we plan to offer.  ______ #acting #vintageausterity #offbroadway #theatre #alcohol #bitchdrinks #stageplay #actor #newyork #play #act
