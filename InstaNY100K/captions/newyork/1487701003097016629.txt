THE THING IS  The thing is to love life to love it even when you have no stomach for it, when everything you've held dear crumbles like burnt paper in your hands and your throat is filled with the silt of it. When grief sits with you so heavily it is like heat, tropical, moist thickening the air so it's heavy like water more fit for gills than lungs. When grief weights you like your own flesh only more of it, an obesity of grief. How long can a body withstand this, you think, and yet you hold life like a face between your palms, a plain face, with no charming smile or twinkle in her eye, and you say, yes, I will take you I will love you, again. -Ellen Bass  PHOTO: CharlotteThomsonArt  #love #God #Jesus #pray #health #fitness #quotes #motivation #nutrition #staywoke #prayers #awaken #spiritual #JesusChrist #lift #newengland #newyork #eastcoast #Buddha #redemption #LETSGO #grace #hallelujah #peace #transformation #rebirth #life #success #nochill
