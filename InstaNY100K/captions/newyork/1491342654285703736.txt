Goldielocs 😍😍 BEEstraight crochet Braids in color 27. No hair left out. Request a basic install for fragile or thin edges, or if you prefer a flatter install. Remember that crochet is big hair... PERIOD. We can thin it out as much as possible but it will not be a flat hairstyle. Plan to take the time to learn how to maintenance any hairstyle you select because IT IS MAINTENANCE THAT MAKES OR BREAKS THE STYLE. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 100% Crochet braids. The part matters😎. BEEstraight, our signature straight install. Hair is included: installed and either silk pressed or semi pressed depending on how textured you like your hair. This is the MOST manageable of the installs and the MOST VERSATILE because it's easy to detangle and can be recurled into almost ANY other curlset you can think of☺️. Lasts 6-8 weeks and is high maintenance. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #BEEstraight #CrochetBraids #BEEstitched #Knotless #HairBEEnatural #naturalhair #texture #kinkycurly #blowout #hotd #love #straight #protectivestyle #NOLEAVEOUT #heatlesshairstyle #travel #Philly #Atlanta #DMV #NewYork #NewJersey #berrycurly #naturalhairdaily #blackhairmag
