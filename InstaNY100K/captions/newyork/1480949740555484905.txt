"LA DUNE" GIN LANE, SOUTHAMPTON SOUTHAMPTON, NEW YORK ▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁ Regarded by many as the finest oceanfront estate in all of the Hamptons, the iconic "La Dune," with links to architect Stanford White offers two extraordinary residences on almost four acres, with over 400 ft. of bulkhead beach front, gorgeous hedged lawns, two custom Gunite pools, and sunken all-weather tennis on Gin Lane. Security gates and hedging open to a wide gravel drive, with the main four-story residence rising majestically from its front parking court. Constructed in the early 1900s, the classic shingle-sided presides over rosa rugosa dunes that slope down to the wide sandy beach.
