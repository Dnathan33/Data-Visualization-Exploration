The Chelsea Market Skybridge: The bridge originally connected the Nabisco factory and its neighboring office building. The Nabisco bakery, office building and, skybridge, as well as the elevated railroad (the High Line) were built between 1890 and the mid 1930s. Nabisco left the buildings in the mid to late 1950s, and all of the structures, including the skybridge and the High Line, were left intact. (I love knowing the history of buildings.) 🚶🏻‍♀️ 🚶🏻‍♀️ 🚶🏻‍♀️ #traveller #wanderer #travelphotography #travelphotos #chelseamarket #chelseamarketskybridge #skybridge #traverse #pedway #bridge #nyc #westvillage #thebigapple #newyork_ig #newyork #architecture_greatshots #architecturelover #architecturephotography #newyorkcity #architectureporn #archilovers #nyc🗽
