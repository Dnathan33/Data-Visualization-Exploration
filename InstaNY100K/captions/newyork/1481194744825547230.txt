Life can change in an instant. What is calm and tranquil one minute can turn into a raging storm the next. Don't ever forget to take the time to appreciate & love where you are and who you're with. It's so easy to get caught up in the "busy-ness" of life...Nothing else really matters except for the people we love...everything else can wait. ❤️#Nature #NewYork #Travel #travelgram #longisland #hamptons #hamptonslife #clouds #reflection
