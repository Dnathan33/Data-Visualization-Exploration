"Dirty old river, must you keep rolling, flowing into the night... as long I gaze on Waterloo Sunset I am in paradise..." "Waterloo Sunset" - Ray Davies  This photo has nothing to do with Waterloo Underground or Sunsets... except everything. I like to go out & take pictures with a soundtrack - a 16 GB iPod "jukebox" of my favorite songs. So this song pops up on shuffle and I point my camera at this bridge.  A famous music critic once called this the most beautiful song in the English language. I don't know if it's all that, but if you ever find yourself walking alone in a dark blizzard and you hear this song, that might not seem like such a preposterous thought.  #stellablizzard #blizzard2017 #corning  #explorecorning #corningflx #iloveny #newyork #ny #upstateny #nys  #newyorkstate  #flx #fingerlakes #fingerlakesny  #ig_masterpiece  #wonderfulplaces #ig_exquisite #ig_shotz  #superhubs #beautifuldestinations #voigtlander #awesomeearth  #special_shots #master_shots  #Voigtlander #natgeo  #sonyalpha #SonyAlphasClub #SonyImages #SonyPhotoGallery a7II | Voigtlander VM 35mm F1.2 Nokton II | ISO 320 | F11 | 15 sec.
