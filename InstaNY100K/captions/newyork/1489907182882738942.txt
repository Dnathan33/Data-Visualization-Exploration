An apple cider vinegar rinse helps clarify and smooth hair cuticles â€“ the secret to shiny hair! Combine a tablespoon of vinegar with a 1/2 cup of water and pour over damp hair. Add a couple of drops of essential oil if the smell is too much. Comb through hair, let it sit for five minutes and then rinse. #hairstyle #stylist #salonlife #haircare #hairofinstagram #hairdresser #hairmagic #Toronto #haircare #celebritystylist #newyork #modelagency #organic #styleonthego #salons #fashion #fashiontoronto #torontostyle #newyorkstyle #newyorksalon #natural #naturalhair #naturalhaircare #diyhaircare #naturalbeauty #organic #organichaircare #organicbeauty #spaday #spa #apple #applecidervinegar
