My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day My cherie amour, distant as the milky way My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore You're the only girl my heart beats for How I wish that you were mine  In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street I've been near you, but you never noticed me My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore That behind that little smile I wore How I wish that you were mine -Stevie Wonder #steviewonder #mycherieamour #poetry #poetic #love #romance #connection #newyork #art #repost #hopelessromantic #jazz #soul #seniorita #bonita #deadpoetsociety
