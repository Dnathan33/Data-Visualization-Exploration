I had the pleasure of doing an interview this week on 99.5 WYCD with a country artist I produced. Jim Buck's song "Hello Operator" was created from lyrics of his late father, Percy Buck, that were found after his passing. Percy was a musician around the area, but his family had never heard him play this song or found any recordings of it.  Jim and I took the lyrics of his father's, and created a complete song to finish what his dad had started.  Percy had passed away on Easter, so it is only fitting that 99.5 is airing this interview and debuting this song on Easter Sunday.  Thank you to Frank Williams Jr. for having us by station.  Looking forward to hearing the interview and song on Sunday evening!
