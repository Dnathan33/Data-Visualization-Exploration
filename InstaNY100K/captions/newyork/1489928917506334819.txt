Looking back, I possessed more and  less, but those were merely just things.  I want to experience life splendidly.  I want to put my fingers on its pulse and feel its altruistic passion.  I want to love life, and have it hold me in its arms forever.  I want life to teach, create me, grow me and evoke me. And in return, I can share those unconditional acts of Love to  someone else.
