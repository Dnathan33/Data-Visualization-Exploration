From my talk at the GA hall earlier this month. Speaking to a group of young students who flew in to #newyork from many places, my aim was to bring forth the voice, challenges and dreams of brave young people living in conflict areas like #Syria and #Iraq and highlight the work of organisations like the @worldfoodprogramme_official & the @unrefugees who on a daily basis are fighting a system so unjust in the hope of alleviating their suffering. Thanks to the wonderful @gclaumun for sharing this moment with me ðŸ’›
