The moon and 2 stars.  I used my tripod and put my camera on manual focus for this. It isn't great, but it's better than an iPhone moon capture, but still less than mediocre. I wasn't even expecting to capture the stars lol so that was a plus.. One day, I'll get a zoom lens.... . . . . . . #moon #tuesday #evening #sky #clouds #cloudporn #stars #instapic #instagam #instagood #amateurphotography #igersNY #lakeCarmel #carmelNY #trees #tree #nature #nikon #nikond3300 #mynikonlife #newyork #dark #igers #myphoto #PictureOfTheDay #potd #photoOfTheDay #goodnight #everythingwillbeokay #instadaily
