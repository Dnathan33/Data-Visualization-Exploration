I believe that art is not only in the form of paintings, sculptures, and music; but also in the world around us. I took this picture from the top of the rock and it's absolutely stunning to me. I edited it as well and it reminds me of a pan out of a city in a movie. - I hope one day I can move to New York and go for my dreams💙🏙 #newyork #rock #topoftherock #landscape #cityscape #photography #art #city #follow #favorite
