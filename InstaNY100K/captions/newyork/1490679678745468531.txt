Art often holds untold power and positivity. It creates comfort and clarity, even in the most uncertain of times. Each and every day this year, I am going to spend some time revisiting one photography book from the Soulcatcher Studio library, from A to Z. Todayâ€™s selection is On Assignment with Arthur Leipzig by Arthur Leipzig (Long Island University Press, 2005). . . . Original photograph by Soulcatcher Studio Gallery Director Eric J. Keller.
