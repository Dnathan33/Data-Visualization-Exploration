Whatever challenges the world may present you this day, know that the Lord has gone before you. He will make flat the mountains that obscure your path. You were fearfully (with reverence) & wonderfully made. Whatever God put in your heart, go out and live your gifts, your passions, your dreams, make the world a better place for your fellow man/woman and the generations that follow. #helpothers #serve #live #walkinfaith #believe #chirst #soldierofchrist #philippians413 #fitfam #shieldsofstrength #nyc #newyork #bettertomorrow
