This pretty in pink-Cocktail is named The Sugarplum ❤️, a recipe I found in 'Regarding Cocktails', in which the Milk&Honey-family shares its wisdom. 🙏 In this case, by bartender Joseph Schwartz.  The Sugarplum is a variation on Patrick Duffy's The Blinker (with rye in stead of gin). The name comes from a pet given to Joseph's wife by her grandmother. The Sugarplum's a sweet cocktail, yet as any other Milk&Honey-creation: perfectly balanced when well executed. 🍸🍸 6cl Gin 3cl Fresh Grapefruit Juice 1,5cl Grenadine  Shake all ingredients vigorously with ice for 15 seconds (until chilled), strain in pre-chilled coupe, for another variation, swap out the gin with tequila. Too sweet? Go easy on the grenadine! 🍸🍸 #PremiumDistilled #Cocktailbar #Bartender #Mixology #Mixologist #CocktailOClock #Drinkstagram #GinTonic #CraftCocktails #PerfectServe #CocktailRecipe #Instadrinks #BelgianBlogger #CocktailOfTheDay #Cocktail #Imbibe #ImbibeGram #Gin #milkandhoney #newyork #Gin #Bulldog #Bulldoglove #GinCocktail #GinOClock #GinLover #Sugarplum #SashaPetraske #ItsFiveOClockSomewhere
