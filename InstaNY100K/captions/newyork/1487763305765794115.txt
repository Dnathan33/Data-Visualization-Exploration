Got my Rotating Flash Bracket yesterday in the mail. When your external flash is connected to your camera, it causes unwanted shadows and red eye. This occurs because the flash is very close to the lens. So using this bracket is suppose to remove red eye and those unwanted shadows, due to the fact that the flash is higher above the lens. I'll be using it today so hopefully it works. #rotatingflashbracket #photography #photographer #vello #photo #work #nyc #accessories #picture #pic #newyork #ny #out #working #awesome #cool #ihopeitworks
