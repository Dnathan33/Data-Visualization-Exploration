Digital lottery win! Won two tickets at the price of $44.50 each due to extra charges. You are able to choose your seats when you win based off of what is still available. We sat 5th row side orchestra and moved to center orchestra during intermission. There are also a limited number of rush tickets being sold when the box office opens for $39.50 each, get there early!
