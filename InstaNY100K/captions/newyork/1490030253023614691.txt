I love the shit out of #newyorkcity. It feels like #home sometimes. This trip, especially. I always said I would be back. I feel closer to that then ever, to spending more time here. I feel blessed to have spent the week roaming, biking, watching, and relaxing in this exciting city. I'm headed home to all my boys now which is just as sweet as this place. ✌🏼see ya later #NYC. 😘 Thanks for the memories. ... ... ... ... ... ... #travel #tourist #travellife #travelblogger #entrepreneur #agencylife #vegas #newyork #iheartnewyork #sunglasses #choker #adventure #curvymodel #curvy #model #selfie
