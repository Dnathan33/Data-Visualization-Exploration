You Win some, You Lose some but you always WIN. Got to the last two after self tape and three auditions. Worked for two weeks pure focus and it came down to another. Good luck to that other. Truly. It wasn't meant for me.  I've seen I'm supported and loved and alot of prayers were said for me. And thankfully I seen its not about the money or exposure it's about doing and reaching for what you love. I know the standard and I move on.  It brought aspects of my childhood up and it made me see, really you got to accept the business that this is and accept you then you really win. And I have. Dogs been walked and friends been told. Thanks for those who thought of me.  I'm sure there will be more tales of my goings on the sea of my dreams.  Never stop. And always build on where you left of. Btw that dog was insane...
