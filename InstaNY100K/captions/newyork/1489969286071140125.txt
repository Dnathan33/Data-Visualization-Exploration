Art New York #workoftheday "Pestana Palace Pool" (2008), oil on canvas by Stephen McKenna. Compliments of @waterhousedodd. McKenna took traditional subject matter and reinterpreted it using layers of wit and irony. His works can be enjoyed for their traditional qualities but a strong conceptual element lies at their core. Every element is considered and has some direct personal relevance to the artist. . . . . . #artnewyork #artmiami #artmiamifairs #art #artscene #artfair #artfairs #local #miami #newyork #StephenMcKenna #WaterhouseDodd #NYC #artinnewyork #artists #mustsee #artwork #artoftheday #photooftheday #friezeny #friezenewyork #friezeweek #canvas #oil
