Attention wonderful group of ladies!!!! It has been officially a month that we have launched our store!!! And it has been an amazing experience.  The other day I've realized that you guys are from all over the country and that is amazing to have connections with people from all over!! That's the beauty of this business!!! In addition, we thought it was about time we shared  a little more about us with you wonderful group of ladies!  My wonderful husband is a Marine Veteran, thus we are a proud Veteran family!! And today we wanted to introduce a Military Discount for all of our Active Duty Military and Veteran families!!!!! If you are a Military family please comment below and we will make note of that! ðŸ’•  And in spirit of our 1 month anniversary we want to extend 10% off on all inventory posted in our albums TO EVERYONE IN THIS GROUP!!!
