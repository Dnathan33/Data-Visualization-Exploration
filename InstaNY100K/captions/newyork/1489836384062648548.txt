Ashbury Park South, 1920 by Florine Stettheimer the poet, critic and artist who was central to the artistic elite of the period - hosting them in her Manhattan salon. Her own work is joyous and illuminating, and this painting was shown on Jeffrey Deitch's stand at the Armory Show where he recreated Florine's pink walled studio.
