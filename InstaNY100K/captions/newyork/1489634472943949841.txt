The reason why massive landmarks are built are to do two things: attract people in awe and make them feel small. Because if you feel small in comparison to a physical structure it subconsciously makes you feel powerless to that entity. The wealthy understand this, the Church understands this, and the Government understands this. But most people don't think about this, they just see it and admire it and move on. I understand the why, but now I want to know the how... idk maybe it's just the Manhattan talking. 🍸🏙#sundayfunday #rockerfeller #barsixtyfive #nbc #newyork #manhattan #sunshine #city #gopro #corporate #radiocity #adventure
