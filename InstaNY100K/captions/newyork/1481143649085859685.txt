Just about to take off on my flight back to NYC and I already miss the romantic evening strolls along the Danube with my partner in crime (he's off to ski in Zermatt for a week while I need to get back to work). I never knew this but Budapest is super romantic and this sign should instead say #budapestisforlovers
