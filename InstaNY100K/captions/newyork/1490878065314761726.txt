This is the train station at 180th street in the Bronx. I've lived in this city for over 20 years - this weekend was the first time I made it up that far into the Bronx. After three hours of riding the train, I definitely felt like I was in a foreign country. Seeing this structure was rather pretty cool.  #compositionofcolors #thebronx #bronx #nyc #newyork #nycarchitecture #architecture #night #nightview #latergram #localliving
