An immense #honor to learn from the #legendary Grandfather of the #houseofninja, @cadadaeadahaea6670! Of every country I've visited over the last two years, no #og has gone so far out of his way in such a short time to show me the true #essence of #dance as this man. If you get the chance to learn from him, even if it's not the #style you come from, take it. Archie Burnett is the #truth. #dancer #dancelife #house #travelgram #newyork #class #whacking #vogue #creationglobal #chicagofootworkjourney
