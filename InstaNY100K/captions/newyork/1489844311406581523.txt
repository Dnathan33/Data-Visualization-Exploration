ðŸš¨PLAYOFFS FIRST ROUND PREVIEWðŸ’¥KREIDER VS PRICEðŸš¨ . Carey Price has been waiting three years for this moment -- which is not a good thing for the Rangers. The world's No. 1 goalie saw his Eastern Conference finals end in Game 1 against the Rangers in May 2014, when winger Chris Kreider crashed into Price and took him out of the series. With Dustin Tokarski in net for the Habs, the Rangers went on to win the Eastern finals in six games. Which is not to suggest the Rangers wouldn't have won with a healthy Price in net, but we'll get a chance to find out. Price, Olympic champion with Team Canada at the 2014 Sochi Olympics, is back and looking as brilliant as ever as the Atlantic Division-champion Canadiens look to get past a very capable Rangers team that is a wild-card team only by virtue of playing in the NHL's toughest division(-ESPN.COM) . . . #Habs #montrealcanadiens #canadiensmtl #gohabsgo #montreal #careyprice #newyork #Rangers #newyorkrangers #blueshirts #chriskreider #playoffs #stanleycupplayoffs #bigapple #bellcenter #80smovies #drivefor25  #hockeyedits #edit #photooftheday #graphicdesigner #artwork #fanmade #gamer #gaming #geekstuff #nerdy #enemymine #movieposter #espn
