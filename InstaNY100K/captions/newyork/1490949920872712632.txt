Vitamin C is a naturally occurring fine line eraser, skin brightener, and anti-oxidant. 🍋🍋🍋 It is safe during all times of life including pregnancy, adolescence, and breast-feeding, and it is amongst the easiest to use skin care products. 🍋🍋🍋 I formulated Platinum Vitamin C+ with high-potency vitamin C, vitamin E, ferulic acid, and acetyl octapeptide to deliver clinically proven skin care results. Along with Platinum Glow Serum and Platinum Hyaluronic Serum, it is one of the most popular products in my line, Dr. Devgan Scientific Beauty. 🍋🍋🍋 . .
