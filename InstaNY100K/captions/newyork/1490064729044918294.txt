The BEST breakfast in NYC is without a doubt SOHO's Ladur√©e. The closest you'll get to Paris outside of France. A must-stop every time I'm busting the Big Apple. Delicious fresh food and beautiful ambiance. Today's treats were raspberry-rose Pain Perdu (Brioche French toast), fruit salad, refreshing Marie Antoinette tea mocktail and a rose petal macaron to nibble while shopping.  #doseofdeliciousness #parisisalwaysagoodidea #takemetoparis #breakfast #frenchtoast #macarons #painperdu #laduree #ladureesoho #prettyinpink #pink #pastry #soho #takingabiteoutofthebigapple #NewYork #NYC #MPTSNYC2017
