When your soul sista moves to NYC for a year with her adorable family. They NEED pictures there! You of course have to go and do it for her because you've been their photographer since the beginning of time. Sometimes sacrifices must be made. Sometimes they include a kidless weekend, with niece and nephew playtime, fanominal company, lots of sister time, a broadway date night, sensational views and lots of laughs and memories made! You know that's what you do for family... take one for the team! ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜† I have such an amazing husband to let me sneak away to make it all possible. More to come, don't you fret!
