These paintings are at the affordable art fair New York today, along with quite a few others, exhibited at the Linda Blackstone Gallery. The fair runs until Sunday. There are lots more far more talented artists exhibiting too. #colour #oilpainting #art #painting #meadows #newyork #newyorkcity #AAFNYC #flowers
