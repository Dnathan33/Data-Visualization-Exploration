This International Development nerd ðŸ¤“ was in her glory today! â€¢ I had the chance to visit the UN Headquarters in New York and see the Security Council.  So many important decisions have, and will continue to be made in this room. â€¢ #newyork #unitednations  #unitednationsheadquarters #internationaldevelopment #securitycouncil #developmentnerd #lifepassion
