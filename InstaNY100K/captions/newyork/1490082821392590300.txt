The scoop behind the song: For "Three Little Birds," @bobmarley was inspired by these birds, possibly pelicans, that would fly and sit next to his home. His friend, Tony Gilbert, said Marley was always inspired by the small things around him. However, three female singers from the reggae group I Threes, who did shows with Marley, claimed it is a reference to them. ~ 🐧🐦🐤 ~
