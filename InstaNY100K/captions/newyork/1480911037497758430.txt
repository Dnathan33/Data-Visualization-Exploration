One of my favorite spots at Gantry Plaza State Park in LIC in Queens. One of the birds' favorites too! With my good friend  @kylenowinski_photos Also: there are a number of really great photographers I follow but for one reason or another I rarely tag---I tagged some of them here. Check out their galleries and you'll see what I mean! Have a great night everyone! ✨✌🏼️👨🏻✨ Camera: Nikon D7200 Lens: Nikkor 10-24 @ 17mm ISO: 100 Aperture: F11 Exposure: 1/40s NEF (RAW) format Post-processing/Edit: Lightroom ✨🌇✨🌆✨🌃✨🐦✨ #ig_captures #igworldclub #worldbestgram #world_shotz #abc7ny #what_i_saw_in_nyc #picturesofnewyork #instagramnyc  #illgrammers #citykillerz #igshotz #ig_worldclub #urbanandstreet #tnyr #wildnewyork #igersofnyc #skyline #skyporn #skylovers #sky_sultans #sky_captures #usaprimeshot #nycgo #nycityworld #architecture #archilovers #waterfront #citybestpics #urbanphotography #queens
