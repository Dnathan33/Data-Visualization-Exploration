"The progression of a painter's work, as it travels in time from point to point, will be towards clarity: toward the elimination of all obstacles between the painter and the idea, and between the idea and the observer." Mark Rothko. . Between 1949 and 1950 Rothko simplified the compositional structure of his paintings and arrived at his signature style. Number 10 dates from 1950 and is one of the earliest and greatest examples of the artist's mature work. This was the first painting by Rothko to enter the collection of MoMA (in 1952) and was so radical for the time that a trustee of the Museum resigned in protest. . #rothko #moma #abex #abstractexpressionism #multiform #number10 #colorfield #greatpaintings #contemporaryart #modernart #newyork #newyorkschool #markrothko
