I first saw these stories pop up onto my Facebook and remembering kinda shrugging them off, thinking that the captions were too long to read. I had other things to do. But they grew more and more popular and they appeared everywhere. So I decided to read one. One turned into another and then another. I was intrigued. I used to find people intimidating. I'd look at them and make assumptions of their lives for them. I my anxiety played a part in that. I'm scared of people. But reading these stories has really made an impact on me. Now I look at people and want to know what their story is, I want to know if they're okay. These stories have me crying, some of them are absolutely heartbreaking and what some of these people go through, their experiences are imaginable. These stories have made me really appreciate what I've got. I've always put others before myself, no matter who. I'd sacrifice the only change in my pocket if it meant that someone could not go hungry for a day, meaning I have to starve, but I don't care. I sometimes thought that what I've been/going through couldn't get any worse, but it's nothing to what some others have.  At the end of the day we're all human, despite our differences, opinions, race, sexuality, religion nothing is gonna change that.  I've decided that I'm going to share my feelings a bit more, because it's so important to talk about it. I got the most kindest message last night and it's been a wake up call. That I shouldn't be ashamed of mental illness because so much others struggle with it.
