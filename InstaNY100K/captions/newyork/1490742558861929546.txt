I'm so happy that I got the opportunity to go to New York! I had so much fun dancing and experiencing the city! I'm so grateful to @lacreaciadance for putting this all together and giving me and 5 other company members this wonderful, amazing chance. ğŸ’–ğŸ’–ğŸ’–ğŸ’–ğŸ’– #mosaictakesmanhattan #uncivilized #newyork
