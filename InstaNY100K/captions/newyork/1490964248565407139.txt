Little late to the party, but a big shout-out to @viking0756 for running an awesome WAL meet at the Man Show in Syracuse. I walked out with 3rd place left handed and more experience to muddle over new techniques to work on. Every step, no matter how small, keeps fueling my fire. I already want more #walunderground #wal #girlswhopull #girlswithmuscles #girlsrule #syracuse #themanshow #nyctreatsmewell #newyork #armwrestling #neverquit #progress
