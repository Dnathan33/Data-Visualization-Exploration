👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾This is a really big deal! Coming from someone with two very expensive college degrees, trust me when I tell you this is a major savings on a quality education. Your college bill has just been reduced to room & board and fees! The income cap is $100,000 increasing to $129,000 by 2019. There's some fine print, sure, but nothing is ever truly free. #suny #cuny #collegelife #newyork #noexcuses #thisisbig #cuomo #proud #follow #education #career #millennials #nyc #ilikesmartpeople #educate-yourself 👩🏽‍🎓
