Just stepped off the plane ✈️ I had the most amazing time in New York 🗽  I definitely didn't make the best decisions... however I'm back in the UK now and instead of turning to a bacon sandwich or croissant I've chosen some melon!  Today is weigh in day...Pray for me! 🔥😂🙈 #sw #slimmingworldmotivation #swfamily #slimmingworld #slimmingworldsupport #swsnack #slimmingworlduk #slimmingworldinspiration #slimmingworldsupport #slimmighworldteam #slimmingworldfollowers #weightloss #myjourney #swvacation #swholiday #newyork
