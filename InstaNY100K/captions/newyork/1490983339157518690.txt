Art brings a feeling like no other. It's like when I'm hold a camera or a paintbrush everything in my world is stripped away. In my creative world I'm freed from disappointment, regret and heartbreak. Im left with nothing other then a bare blank canvas. It's just me in that moment. I'm free of everything and anything. I get lost in passion. I feel like I'm everything and nothing all at once. |sv| 100//365 . . . . . #shyann365 #nikon #nikond3300 #nikonphoto #nikonphotography #nyfw #nikon_photography #d3300 #50mm #nycphotographer #ny #newyork #nyc #newyorkcity #portrait #portraits #portraiture #portraitphotography #cabin #centralpark #manhattan #blogger
