ITS NOT ABOUT RACE, ITS JUST CULTURE â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢ society, specifically "popular culture" promotes such stupidity and the glorification of being absolutely shallow that they wonder why they give birth to dumb bitches like this one ^ this ain't shocking, this is just our current generation of tweens, like it genuinely doesn't shock me that some people actually look up to her because who cares about talent right? ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Ši'm from ny and disgustingly girls from age 12-15 act like this and they find it attractive blleehhhh and for all you black folks or poc "offended" by her behavior acting like the streets aren't filled with black/latino ugly ghetto THUGS, this is technically what you raised lol, she said so herself she was raised in the streets and the streets are NOT suburban friendly areas okay? i live in the bronx borough and live in a very hood ass neighborhood with mostly blacks and hispanics who are heavily influenced on what black people call "black culture" (imma project girl) and even the whitest of white people act like their hood if you get what i mean? (use excessive slang, have heavy accents etc..)i don't know how to explain that without being racist, i'm definitely not saying all black people act like this it's just that there are certain black neighborhoods (the ghetto, the hood whatever you wanna call it) where they are notorious for doing crime and drugs and acting a certain way ya feel me?? girl was clearly raised with ghetto ass black/ hispanics who do drug dealing for living and give birth to uglies such as this bitch. and then their are the others who play the victim card "if she was black she would've never gotten popular" JXJJSBD are y'all stupid?? ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ many black celebrities have achieved success without having an inch of talent so stop playing dumb lol i'm tired of seeing this little bitch on my feed, i needed to let out steam...ooh that rhymed, okay bye.  _ _ _ #daniellebregoli #thestreets #ghetto #blackpeople #whitepeople #tumblr #popularculture #culture #worldstarhiphop #hiphop #thebronx #newyork #newyorkcity #cashmeoutsidehowboutdat #rant #race #racism #drphil #blackculture #africanamerican #thehood #thugs #likeforlike #tagsforlikes
