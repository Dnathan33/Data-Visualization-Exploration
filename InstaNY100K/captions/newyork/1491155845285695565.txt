I got my lazy self off the beaches today and just walked. Currently I'm solo travelling for about a week so it's time for a few adventures. Here's one of those moments of just being in the right place at the right time:  I chose a spot on Google Maps and just headed in that direction. I took a wrong turn and found myself walking towards a parade! These 2 young men were being paraded down the street with gamelan instruments being played at full volume behind them. I asked someone but due to my ears beings as bad as they are these days + gamelan music I couldn't hear why this parade was happening. At a guess, maybe these 2 young chaps were from an important family and perhaps the older one was coming of age, I don't know. But there you go, it's important to take your camera out with you at all times, you never know what you might run in to!
