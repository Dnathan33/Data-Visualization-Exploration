In the Museum of Modern Art’s 1981 catalogue for the exhibition "New Works on Paper 1," John Elderfield (then Chief Curator) gave credence to how the giving and taking of space across  Dan Christensen’s surfaces, whether frontal or open, gave his art coherence and stability. At the same time, Elderfield observed that Christensen’s new work suggested certain organic allusions, writing: "Its very creation of geometry from gesture invites comparison with spontaneous natural growth, just as the particular structures thus formed invite comparison with specific fragments and forms of the natural world.” [Dan Christensen "Asante" 1980 acrylic on canvas 51 x 71 inches] #danchristensen #color #colorfield #painting #johnelderfield #moma #curator #berrycampbell #gallery #newyork #chelsea #modern #contemporary #art
