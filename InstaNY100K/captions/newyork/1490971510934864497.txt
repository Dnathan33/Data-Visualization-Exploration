Love these old tripods. From the materials, color choice and styling; I'm assuming it was late 60s early 70s. Ensign Senior SSS tripod.  I needed a tripod for my mic and this was a whopping $4.00. it's legs were loose, and the head was missing the pan/tilt arm/lock. Tapped a 1/4" rod, epoxied a lock nut and made a handle from cherry. I think this addition will serve me quite a while. . .
