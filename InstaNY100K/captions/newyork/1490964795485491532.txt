Chasing the sunset Searching for tomorrow A destiny that will never be met To which a hope will borrow For if you stop to think All thoughts will dissapear Before you even blink The answer will be clear Like a dream come true A goal you finally meet It will come to you;  The answer that you seek It may not look correct It may even seem wrong Just follow with respect The truth will come along #sunset #sunrise_sunsets_aroundworld #sunset_pics #sunsetporn #sunsetsky #iloveny #seeyourcity #bigapple #newyorkinstagram #newyork_instagram #welcometonewyork #newyorknewyork #newyork #newyorkcity #newyorklife #nyc #nycgo #newyorker #newyorktimes
