Hello....as per requested - tomorrow Wednesday  April 12 at 12;00 pm US Eastern Standard time I will be on live video. I will walk you through on how to paint this flower; White Anemone. I know - this is suddenly because I wanted to show you to paint them from real Anemone; a life. And I need to hurry because the flower is almost died. And Anemones are not always available around my area. So I hope they still fresh tomorrow - I think they will. So see you tomorrow.üòÉüòç @nykwrites @allthingsyoom . . #watercolorpainting #watercolorflowers #watercolorflorals #botanicalwatercolor #livevideo #anemones #anemonetutorial #art_we_inspire #watercolorist #watercolorartists #watercolorillustration #longisland #longislandmy #newyork #newyorkartists #longislandart #longislandartists #ellyaart
