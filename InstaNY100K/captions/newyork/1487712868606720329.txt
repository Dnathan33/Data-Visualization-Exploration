#AuctionCountdown  Lot #25  K. K. HEBBAR Untitled Oil on canvas, 1975 34.0 x 40.0 inches ‘My works are generated by my intense feeling to my environment. I seek to find myself and follow it to whatever course it leads’ – K. K. Hebbar  This Untitled work depicts a landscape but with a twist – there is no line of horizon, the houses and mountains are laid across the picture plain, moving vertically, akin to a Japanese landscape painting. A band of concave yellow ochre hugs the green plains to perform a dual role: it works as a pictorial device to provide a contrast to the expanse of sap green, and it also forms the ledge from where the scene is viewed. But the solitary house with a group of huddled figures is observed from yet another perspective, giving the entire picture multiple points of entry. Here, Hebbar’s modus operandi is to paint the landscape as he experienced and felt it, the painting relying on his ‘vision’ rather than the temporal reality of the scene in front of him.
