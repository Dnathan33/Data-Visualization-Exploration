Do we have any Ojai people who have visited the @beatricewoodcenter for the Arts? Beatrice actually moved to Ojai in 1947 and stayed until she passed away shortly following her 105th birthday. She was known as a studio potter who was born in San Francisco. As a child she moved to New York after the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906. While there she studied painting and then acting in Paris. With the beginning of World War I, she moved back to New York where she became involved in the Avant Garde movement. Later, she began drawing and sculpting. Eventually moving to Ojai so she could be near the Indian philosopher J. Krishnamurti. It seems that no matter where Beatrice was, she always followed her heart, which never failed her.
