It’s hard to believe that it’s been a year to this day since I took this picture. This was one of the most exciting and scary moments of my life. I was 25 and working at a gym for someone else while trying to create my own company. I would’ve never imagined all the things that have happened for me this past year in the fitness industry, but I’m beyond grateful and truly blessed. I couldn’t have made any of it happen without the support of every one of you. In the past few days I’ve gotten a lot of messages asking me about why I changed the Royal Change IG account name to my personal name and I just wanted to clarify that @royalchange still exists and there is a new IG account for it but, as with any company, mine is taking a path of it’s own that I am trying to follow it and I am doing what I feel is the most advantageous for it. I’m still young and I don’t know all the right answers or business moves, but with me being the only face that was representing the Royal Change IG account, I felt this was more appropriate to let go of the ego of running a “brand” IG account and offer you more of me on a fitness and personal level. I want to thank all of you for helping in my success and for all of the messages concerned about @royalchange -  I just want to reassure you that it still exists and there is a new account for it; we’re just trying to figure out what direction to point that IG account in. This isn’t any major business change, it’s simply just an IG account name change. Royal Change and my website, www.royalchange.fit, still exists and I have some big things in store for you with it that I can’t wait to release in the near future!
