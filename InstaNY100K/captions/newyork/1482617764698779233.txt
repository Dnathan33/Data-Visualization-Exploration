Good evening, @choi_seung_hyun_tttop ssi! Did you do anything new today? I hope you had a good day. This is a #chair that you can lay on to erase all the cares of the day with a good book, wine, or music. I love #chaise loungers. This #furniture is made around #1837 by #Duncan #Phyfe (#1770â€“#1854) in #NewYork. The materials are #mahogany, #ash and  #pine #woods. I am more of a leather person when it comes to these, but this red fabric goes well with the #stain. I hope you get to snooze a little longer. Tomorrow will be a good day. #chairs #art #artporn #museum #gallery #wood #upholstery #artwork
