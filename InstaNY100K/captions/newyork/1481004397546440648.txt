A throwback to Printemps, Paris in 2011. I felt so much better today after going through my old travel photos. Because in the last few days, I have been having lower back pain even after my physiotherapy treatment. To top it off, my Psoriasis is flaring up and these health issues are making me so depressed. ðŸ˜¢ I just want to share that life is not always perfect. Being authentic and real is much more relatable to others. Enjoy the rest of the week.
