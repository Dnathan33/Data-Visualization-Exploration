ARGUMENT FOR EVOLUTION |  Heading back into #Yorkville to pick up another group of business travelers @fstoronto this morning. ___  For more than a little while I've been waiting for the #business case of private city tours to bear substantial fruit. Our value proposition presents us as the 'fastest, most exciting way to learn the city.' With assistance from the talented concierges @lesclefsontario the dream is becoming a reality. ___  This is another piece by #PatrickAmiot which reminds me of two relevant stories; the slow grind of evolutionary biology and the fairy tale of kissing the frog. ___  As you travel to work today consider this - maybe you're already the #fabulous amphibian. Whether you took the slow road to entrepreneurial success or received a #kiss from venture #capital , make sure you love what you do. ___  #urban ■ #lifestyle ■ #travel ■ #adventure ■ #tourism ■ #outdoors ■ #art ■ #learn ■ #explore ■ #city ■ #culture ■ #entrepreneur ■ #experience ■ #realestate ■ #diversity ■ #luxury ■ #hustle ■ #success ■ #Toronto ■ #Montreal ■ #Ottawa ■ #Kingston ■ #NewYork
