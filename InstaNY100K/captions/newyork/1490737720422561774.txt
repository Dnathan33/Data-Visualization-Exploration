I want to take a moment to go back to just 3-4 years ago, where I would never imagine myself to be where I am today. I started living out my dream earlier than planned. How? Because I took the leap. I told myself, the worst that comes out of following your wildest dreams, is you meet more people and get some pretty cool experiences out of it. Never did I imagine that at 19, I would be having dinner with @lorealmakeup and @alisonbrodmc (last night's look!) 🌟What helped me tremendously was taking pre-college courses to experiment with what I like or dislike early on; to give me the early boost of confidence. @fashioncampnyc gives girls (and boys!) the amazing opportunity to do just that in their summer program. The program, offered in two sessions, includes amazing industry speakers, field trips, fun hands on projects, and connections that I promise will last you a lifetime. ❤️I highly encourage all my youngsters to check it out. I'm all about gaining early on experiences and I only wish I knew of this when I was in MS or HS.👊🏽You can register here: [ http://bit.ly/FCNYAC ] #fashioncampnyc #fcnycpartner  Please feel free to message with me any questions, always happy to chat! 💕
