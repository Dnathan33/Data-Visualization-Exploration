We are super excited to be hosting the next #littlegirls4bigchange bake sale this Saturday 4/15 from 12-3.  All proceeds from the bake sale will be donated to a local charity. Stop by for a good cause and of course, a sweet treat 🍪 A big THANK YOU to @pinkolive and @meghancorridan for inviting us to join in 😘 #normanandjules #lg4bc #wearebettertogether
