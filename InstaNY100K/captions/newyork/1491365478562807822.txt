Ahh, it's like Christmas in April. I ordered this box full of goodies from @craftsuppliesusa a few days ago. Me being me I was tracking the package and it was set to arrive Thursday. Well I sure was surprised to have it on my doorstep this morning! Props to them on quick and professional service. Now I've got enough bottle stopper parts and turning blanks to keep me busy for a little while. Oh, and corkscrews too! And Walnut oil! ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ .  #wood #woodworking #woodturning #woodcraft #lathe #lathelife #winestopper #bottlestopper #corkscrew #kitchen #kitchenstuff #turningblank #ash #honeylocust #silvermaple #osageorange #craft #fair #craftfair #forsale #freelance #woodworker #longisland #selden #newyork
