I got to meet @jenniferdziura at the @GetBullish Society warehouse party this week! I've been reading Jen's blog for a few years now and love her straight-up advice, take-no-prisoners approach, prioritization of dignity, and fun sense of humor. We made bead bracelets, chatted, and played with the baby. ðŸ‘Œ (Photo by @jenniferdziura & @jpalkowitsh.) . . . #getbullish #bullishsociety #bullish #hustle #feminist #work #workingwoman #sidehustle #multipleincomestreams #party #beads #babies #pink #subversive #lifegoals #starstruck  @neverwearblack #nyc #newyorkcity #newyork #brooklyn #explore
