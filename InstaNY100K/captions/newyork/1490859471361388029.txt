EXTREMELY LOUD & INCREDIBLY CLOSE (2011) Based on a novel by Jonathan Safran Foer (2005). Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Thomas Horn  Oscar Shell loses his father on September 11, 2001 and he's trying to find out why and also find the lock that matches a mysterious key his father had left behind. I really like Oscar's personality because he's extremely different from others. He's autistic, he's afraid of too much noise in the city, he hurts himself a lot or he wears a gas mask when he feels he's in danger. I'm in love with the soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat. And of course Oscar's mum - Sandra Bullock - is amazing. And Oscar's dad - Tom Hanks - makes this movie even more touching! You have to be patient while watching this movie. There's not that much action. But it's worth seeing it. The story is strong. I like the idea of someone's own world, which is actually much bigger and includes more lives than the person thinks.  #extremelyloudandincrediblyclose #novel #movie #film #tomhanks #sandrabullock #thomashorn #violadavis #actress #actor #september11th #newyork #autism #worldtradecenter #thesixthborrough #alexandredesplat #soundtrack
