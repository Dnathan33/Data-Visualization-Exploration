I missed #NationalPetDay, but since I already post plenty of pictures of my two demons, I figured I'd get caught up with #NationalSiblingDay. My brother is my best friend. When we were younger, people constantly asked if we were twins, and even though we're 3 years apart and haven't lived in the same city for a while now, he still manages to finish my sentences and knows exactly what I'm thinking. I love him to death, am extremely proud of what he's done and where he's going, and am counting down the days till he graduates and gets to come back home to spend the summer with me ðŸ’™
