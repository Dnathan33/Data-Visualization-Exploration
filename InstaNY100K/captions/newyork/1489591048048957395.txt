If you know me you know how petrified i am of snakes 🐍. I have a snake 🐍 phobia. My first attempt to overcome this was a snake tattoo on my left ankle and today I had two snakes on my neck. Did I let out a both scream? Hell yeah!!!! But they told me I would get a ticket. Lol 😂 Well, I think I did good given the fact that I hate snakes.... ✌🏼😳 #snakes🐍 #yes #iscreamedlikealittlebitch #lol #phobia #snakephobia #newyork #centralparkmoments #manhattannewyork
