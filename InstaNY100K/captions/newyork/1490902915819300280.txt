The past few days I have been drenching myself in my beloved @coach EDP! I wrote a post on it back in December and it's still a favourite fragrance! Perfect for these warm, sunny days it's uplifting, luxurious with bright, sparkling raspberry which gives way to creamy Turkish roses, before drying down to a sensual suede musk base note! Feminine, flirty and fun! Plus the bottle is incredible! Have you tried it yet?
