NEVER TRADE OF YOUR PHONE THIS IS A SCREENSHOT FROM MY PHONE! ONLY MONITOR POSITIONS FROM YOUR MOBILE DEVICE  Last week there was analysis given out on my story to SELL USDJPY on break of 110.266 and target 109.730 to downside! The TAKE PROFIT HAS BEEN HIT ACCUMULATING 54 PIPS LIVE! TECHNICAL APPROACH: I want to see a pullback up to 110.100/110.530 and above level to see if that Resistance wants to hold to potentially open up SELL opportunities! TARGET TOO DOWN SIDE WILL BE 109.00 TARGET 2 107.530 EXTENDED TARGET 105.460 (LONG TERM) Take my analysis with a grain of salt and always make sure to feel confident with your analysis before you look at anybody else's. Make sure to have at least 2 confluence confirmations before executing a trade! Forex carries a high degree of risk results are not typical!
