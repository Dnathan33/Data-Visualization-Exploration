The week before moving back to Colorado was the most fun but definitely the hardest because I knew my chapter in the city was coming to an end. I spent the first chunk of the week exploring with my best friends who came to visit and the second part with my sister, her hubby and my nieces. Naturally, I was questioning my decision to head back to Denver but knew that it was the right decision for me.
