They say age is just a #. I say "it's true so long as you take care of yourself, feed your body real food, get sufficient sleep and not over train". They say anything is possible when you put your mind into something. I say, "it's true so long as you have a strong belief system. Everything starts and ends with the mind. The only thing stopping you from having the body you want or anything you want is you". They say the body starts to go backwards in your 50's. I say, "only if you let it it will. There is a new generation of fitness trainers who are proving this theory wrong, a generation of nutrition coaches that now know better based on evolutionary meal planning & scientific research. Ones who adopt that hands on approach, so to share with clients what works and why so they to can improve so to live a healthy/happy life". What do you want to look like at 55??? It all starts and ends with nutrition, plain and simple! 👍🏻💯🎯👍🏻💯🎯👍🏻💯🎯 DM me with nutrition & training questions! #fitnessmotivation #nutritionfirst #fitnesscoach #mealplanning #nyc #personaltrainer #instagood #instafit #getfitwithray #beachbody #newyork #nutritioncoach #fitfam #fitlife #fitspo #fitspiration
