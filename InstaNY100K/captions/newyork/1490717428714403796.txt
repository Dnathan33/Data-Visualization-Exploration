Decided to put in some Core Speed today to get a taste of what I will begin next week as I revisit Focus T25! . After completing 60 days of Hammer and Chisel which is mainly weight lifting, it was scary and refreshing to get in some cardio work today... . I felt the sweat dripping and it felt Ah-mazing!!! . Anyone else feel like they had a better workout when their clothes are soaking wet from sweat?! 🤷🏻‍♀️
