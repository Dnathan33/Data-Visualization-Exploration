Inspired by the revolt: one woman artist a day who pushed against the system to express herself as an artist. Today: Nancy Spero (d.2009) - A pioneer of feminist art. Her work since the 1960s is an unapologetic statement against the pervasive abuse of power, Western privilege, and male dominance.  Her etchings, which are overworked after the etching process, were described by her studio assistant as artworks that you might find if you scratch under wall paint and suddenly get revealed (Art21.org). She said that she felt ‘doomed to be an artist’ because she drew all over the margins of pages and didn’t enjoy school or university; she felt like the only thing she could do was draw and paint, even though she initially felt that it was useless to society.  By the late 1960s she had already developed herself into an artist who was very important, not useless, to society and the international voice of women.  Torture of Women (1976) uses trauma narratives from Amnesty International’s 1975 report, which she combined with small subversive images meant to catch the viewer and provoke thought;  the effect of them together is tough to receive - truth that is not hidden behind decoration, but presented to be swallowed whole and without apology.  She said of those small, subversive works “My work rebels against very large paintings because I’m trying to break down the authority they imply”. Still such a poignant comment in the highly capitalised and macho art world today.
