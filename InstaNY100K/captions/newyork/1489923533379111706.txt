Did you know you are like the people you surround yourself with? Do they support your values or mindset? Are they making you stretch your capacity or do they question your goals? Good friends will want you to do more in life. They won't make you feel bad for where you are going. Take advice from those who have integrity and have done more than you. Ultimately it is your decision. Remember it's not the amount of friends you have, it's the friends that support and endorse you to do, be, have and want to give more for yourself. Don't be limited to the people you know, seek new friendships to stretch you in your dreams! Treasure those who have supported you from the beginning. üéÅ#business #ceo #leadership #moniquejustus #save20years  #20x #friends #protectyourdreams #seattle #newyork #losangeles
