Isolated. ---- Posting this because I'm getting on a plane in less than an hour, and when I do, I'll be turning off my phone and isolating myself from social media. There will be plenty of photos, videos, and stories for me to share when I get back, but in the meantime, I'm going to do everything I can to savor every moment of this week away.
