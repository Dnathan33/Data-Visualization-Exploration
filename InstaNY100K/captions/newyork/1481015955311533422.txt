#Repost @australia with @repostapp ãƒ»ãƒ»ãƒ» Good morning guys.Picture yourself strolling along the squeaky-clean sands of @lordhoweislandtourism, the colossal cloud-capped Mt Gower looming in the distance... On the @greatwalksofoz Seven Peaks Walk, you'll be surrounded by striking scenery in all directions ðŸ‘Œ This epic five-day guided adventure run by @pinetreeslodge traverses sheltered beaches, misty rainforests and spectacular sea cliffs. Did we mention the volcanic peaks and rare birdlife as well? Photo: Luke Hanson in @visitnsw #newsouthwales #greatwalksofaustralia #lordhoweisland #hiking #walking
