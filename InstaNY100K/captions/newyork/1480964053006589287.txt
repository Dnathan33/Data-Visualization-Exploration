"I always had a passion for art , before my formal dance training I was a beautiful painter and artist and through my art and dance Im learning to become a beautiful model .  Even tho now I'm not dancing as much , I will never forget how you comfort me when I was told I would never make it . Eventually with the hard work I did . For that dance , GOD  and the heavens, I owe you my all . ❤" • • • • • • • • • #dance  #contemporary  #newyork #potrait  #ballet  #model  #modern #poise #like4like  #black #african #jamaican #wendsday #quotes #poetry
