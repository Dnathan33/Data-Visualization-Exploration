“I don’t know what to say to them,” Rae cried.  Girl, just say you miss and love them. Tell them about your new school and tell them you’re safe and much happier.  I uttered “happier” just before realizing I shouldn’t have. My suppressive levee of pettiness occasionally breaks every now and then. And, I’m learning to be okay with it. I’m human with real feelings. Period. Point. Blank.  Don’t side-eye me. I know what you’re thinking. “Happier” isn’t that bad or petty. Furthermore, it’s true. They are very happy. You’re probably also thinking: how can one be petty with kids. Right? Let me explain.  Me adding happier most definitely came from a snarky place.  Don’t get me wrong, my pettiness isn’t direct at them but at the circumstantial closeness of our relation. If I took in two random children things would feel different.  I wouldn’t be bias or affected as much. So, petty Betty pops up every single time I’m reminded of my father. And, with the kids here (Zae specifically) I’m reminded daily. I don’t voluntarily think of him.  New Blog "Petty Betty"! Read the rest at www.sistamom.com  Link in bio.  Comment, share and be challenged to grow. Subscribe, too and be inspired!
