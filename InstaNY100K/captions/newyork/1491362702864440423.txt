It's that perfect mixture of concrete jungle and central park...its a certain kind of magic that I missed and got back for the briefest of moments.  I feel a special kind of love (and annoyance) for this place that keeps drawing me back to its sky high buildings, too many people and noises. It's glamour and it's dirt. It's New York. #anditsgotapartofmyheart#leavingbitsandpiecesbehind#adventures#exploring#travelling#newyork#inlove
