Funds needed as plane fuel is $4.50 a gallon! #Repost @loho1217 with @repostapp ・・・ PLEASE NETWORK 📧 AND DONATE 💵. These very special FIV+ OCAS survivors are headed to a new life thanks to @baileybiscuits for pulling them, getting them healthy and loving them immensely. They are headed on a flight this weekend from Florida to New York and the loving arms of Marcia Scott and Happy Cat Rescue, Inc. in upstate New York! We are asking for donations to say thank you to Marcia for taking these kitties in and helping to get them adopted out to loving homes. If you can contribute, please donate to PayPal account: mysaffarinc@gmail.com and reference OCAS KITTIES FREEDOM RIDE.
