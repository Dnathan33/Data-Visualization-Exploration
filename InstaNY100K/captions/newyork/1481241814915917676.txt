Y'all, have you tried my chickpea chocolate chip bars?! If not, you are missing out!! There is no flour, no added artificial sugar in the dough and they are DELICIOUS!!! I shared this recipe last year and I crave them all the time! Dessert with all the flavor but without the guilt, yes please! 🙋🏻🍪 {link in bio}
