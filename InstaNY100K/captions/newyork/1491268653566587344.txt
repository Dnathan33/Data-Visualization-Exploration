4. If you were to ever tell me that I was going to photograph a wedding at a hilltop apple orchard in New Hampshire on a magically misty Fall day this time last year, I would have said, No wayyyyyyyy. And, if you would have told me that said wedding would rekindle one of the sweetest friendships I have ever been lucky to have, I wouldn't have even known what to do with myself. It's funny to think about, but I met @erinthestone  over 10 years ago now (Erin, are we getting old? I'm not sure how I feel about this). We were a few years apart at our undergraduate alma mater, and we later became good work colleagues at the same college, often exchanging anecdotes about Michael Scott from The Office and obsessing over our cats. Who would have known that being able to remain connected via social media would turn into one of the best wedding adventures I would ever have? I think about Erin + Ben's engagement session and wedding day often. I think about their warm hearts and hospitable characteristics, letting me crash on their couch and snuggle their cats. I think about how they are fantastic for each other, and how they complement each other so well. I think about the threat of rain on their wedding day, but how they got married outside anyway (which made this photographer's heart SING). I think about the myriad of people at their day, and how they were all so thrilled to be there to celebrate. I think about it pouring that evening, and being thankful that those water droplets held off just a few extra hours so that we could get some stunning shots. And I loved this bouquet. It was like a sweet burst of sunshine on that misty day. Kind of like Erin's heart in this world. ðŸ’•
