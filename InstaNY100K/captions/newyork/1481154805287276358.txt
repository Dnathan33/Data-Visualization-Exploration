BROOKE ASTOR was born on 30 March 1902. She was the heiress to the oldest fortune in America, was also, rather suitably, one of its greatest philanthropists. The sums were not vast in 21st century terms – she dispatched something like US$195 million over 37 years. It might be said by the cynical that she simply enjoyed giving away her late husband’s fortune but it was how she did it that made her so greatly admired. She was fond of quoting the eponymous star of Hello Dolly, “Money is like manure; it’s not worth a thing unless it’s spread around”. And yet, despite this earthy quote, Mrs. Astor, THE Mrs. Astor,  was nothing like Dolly Levi.  She was an exceptional combination of glamour, wealth, charm, discipline, endurance, common sense, and old fashioned good manners. The other element was her astonishing longevity. At 105, she must have been the oldest grande dame in history. Her beloved father’s enduring advice to her was, “Brooke, don’t ever get beyond yourself” and it must be said she paced herself superbly. (Her only rival, Madame Chiang-kai Shek, died in October 2003, aged 106). As for her youthful look, Brooke admitted to once having had her neck done, but said, "Face-lifts are a mistake. People pull their faces so much that suddenly they're all nose. And you can't push your nose back or cut it off on the side." She also resisted Prozac, disliking ‘the false gaiety’ that accompanied it. She kept fit well into her nineties by swimming 1,000 strokes each weekend day and nearly every day in summer, even in the chilly waters that surrounded her house in Northeast Harbor. She had always been vague about her age until it was discovered she was 90. The secret of her stamina and longevity was, she told W magazine in 1991, "Discipline, in every way. You can have fun, but don't eat so much, don't drink so much. Flirt a little, but don't get too involved." She resisted a fourth husband, “I just don’t want anyone tugging at my sleeve at 10 o’clock telling me it’s time to go home.” New Yorkers are constantly reminded of the good works of Brooke Astor. And the name of Astor in America now evokes something more worthy than mere wealth and prestige. 📷regram @pgayetapp
