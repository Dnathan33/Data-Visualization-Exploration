Inspired by all you Brighton Marathon Runners i thought I'd go for a run this morning. I've heard a lot of people recommend the river running path in this area. I wasn't going to mention anything, but strava actually crashed after my first 2.5k. I mean I was barely going to mention it, you know me guys, I'm not one for attention. I'm all about the self reward and hard work, not the accolades. It's hardly worth bringing it up. But technically I ran a very fast 10k this morning. For fun. On an empty stomach, hot weather and a weekend hangover. Honestly though... Forget I said anything.... 10k #eastriverpath #morningrun #10k #running #nyc #NewYork #eastriver #beautifulday #startthedayright
