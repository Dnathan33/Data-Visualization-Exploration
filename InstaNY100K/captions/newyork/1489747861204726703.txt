Newyork newyork! Well mostly ppl ask me for hair care! As i have long hair so offcourse they need care... so two tips! 1: i mix four oils (coconut,olive,mustard,almond) equal quantity u can mix them and put it in a jar... i apply it twice a week for two hours before shower!  2: make mayo hair mask and apply it every month (1 egg, 1tbsp mayonnaise, 1 tbsp yougurt, 1tsp honey, 1tsp olive oil) mix all these together and apply for 45 mins! Then take shower! 👍🏻 #hair #haircare #newyork #travel #travelling #instagram #instatravel #instagood #statueofliberty #mytraveldiary #seetheworldthroughmyeyes #longhairdontcare #photography #camera #view #views  #tbt #usa #america #nyc #nyc🗽 #beauty #tips #beurself #winters #noextentuonsneeded #noextentions
