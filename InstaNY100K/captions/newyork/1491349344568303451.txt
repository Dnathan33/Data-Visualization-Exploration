R. H. Macy & Co. Dry Goods in Union Square 1858-1875. The birthplace of a new idea! Located at 204 East 14th St. This was the first location in NY after a failed attempt in retail in Massachusetts. Ever wonder why Macy's has used the star as their logo? Macy had a tattoo of a star when he was a teenager when he worked on whaling ships in Nantucket! #macys #ny #newyork #unionsquare #vintagenewyork
