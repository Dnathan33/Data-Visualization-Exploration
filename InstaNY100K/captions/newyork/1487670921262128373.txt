Happy Friday Stone Wall Fam! Tons of people believe that dieting means eating less and cutting food...we are here to tell you that is not the case. You can eat more times a day (for example , six times) with smaller portions . Or you can eat larger potions but less times a day (3 large meals) but these meals must be healthy. We aren't talking 3 trips to mcdonalds , we are talking grilled chicken, steamed broccoli and a baked sweet potato. That's just one example of something we would put together. We don't want you guys out here starving yourself. Eat but just eat better! EAT! #stonewallfitnessandathletics #swfa #fitfam #fitspo #fit #fitlife #gainz #gym #fitness #fitnessmotivation #calisthenics  #trainhard #noexcuse #fitteam  #stonewallfam #healthyfood #fitnessmotivation  #newyork #newyorkcity #fortdrum #jerseycity #hoboken #love #instadaily #instagood #instahealth #healthyeating #military #family #igfit
