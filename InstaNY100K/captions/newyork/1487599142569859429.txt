QUAD(s). I've been super hesitant about squatting heavy since I hurt my groin in October. Hit 2 sets of 205x5 at a 4am session. Slow and clean. I'll take it. Makes me realize I'm stronger than I think. @thestrongjewish when are you guys coming to play on Long Island?  #legday #riseandgrind #squat #girlswhoworkout  #girlswholift  #longisland  #newyork #ny #inov8 #powerlifter
