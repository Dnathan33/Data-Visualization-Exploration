Welcome to #tuesdayinspirations! Grab some coffee, because there are 10 of us this week who hope to inspire you to move it + shake it! When you're finished reading this caption, you'll be led to go on to the next @simplyposhpaper and I recommend you follow her because she's some kind of awesome!Today's question is: What's one thing you do regularly that keeps your head in the game?  For me, I make sure to consistently assess the people around me. Some will pretend to be heavily supportive of your journey yet faithfully wish failure upon you. Be sure to keep everyone at arm's length and avoid giving out 100% of your ideas to those who seek to benefit from them.  What about you?
