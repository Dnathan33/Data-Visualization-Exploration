O P E N 🏠: We'd like to introduce our third artist and her textile designs, showcased at the pop-up this upcoming weekend. Mengly Hernandez (@missmengly) grew up in NYC where she works as a stylist. In 2013, Hernandez founded the brand Linea Germania (@lineagermania), creating her own line of silk scarves. Her textiles are bold and sophisticated, and the patterns are conceived with great sensitivity, resulting in wearable pieces of art. Both colors and patterns leave space for imperfection and freedom, a reflection of her own taste and work process.
