Other fascinating details we learned from @qmagazineuk (in stores mañana). More to come later, sorry, journée folle au travail 😱: - Among those who turned down guest spots are Sade and, after a “month long email exchange,” Morrissey (huh? Morrissey? Weirdo and we heard this rumor and were like... eh, ok) Dionne Warwick also refused because the lyrics conflicted with her religious beliefs. - Damon says "I don’t take rejection personally". He's perfect. - Jamie Hewlett reveals that a 10-episode Gorillaz TV show is in the works. He's also working on Gorillaz merch and clothing line. Trop cool! - like we said yesterday... Demon Dayz Festival... Allo Chicago ! - Damon starts everyday with a purple foaming juice and a cigarette 💞. - Albarn says The Good, the Bad & the Queen have been working on a new LP for three years, with Brexit providing renewed inspiration. (He's a genius) - Damon and Jamie didn’t speak for three years. After a Blur show in 2015 they got drunk and decided to revive Gorillaz. - Also Damon drunk text (😱🍸🍷) - Fancies himself a sharecropper. - We learned nothing new about a MONTREAL or NEW YORK concert date 😡. #Gorillaz #GorillazWatch #QMagazine #DamonAlbarn #JamieHewlett #Love #Music #Merch #Clothes #Tv #Friendship #Sade #Morrissey #DionneWarwick #Why #Whatèveure #Smoothies #Festival #Chicago #TGTBTQ #Blur #WeLoveGorillaz and #HolyShit we can't keep up now, we'll post more TONIGHT.
