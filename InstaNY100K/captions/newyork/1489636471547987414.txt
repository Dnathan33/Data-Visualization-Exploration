Happy National Unicorn Day ü¶Ñ! Red Riding Hood the Warrior is probably my favorite cosplay. It's the first worbla armor I ever made and is based off the original art of AMSBT on Deviant Art. I also competed for the first time and won second place with her at the inaugural C2E2 Crown Championship, but the best part of that was meeting the other contestants backstage of which I made life long friends! This was also the first shoot I ever did! I remade the breastplate and a few other things for the contest but this originally took me two weeks to make. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èDon't forget to tune into #Syfy on Tuesday at 10|9c for #CosplayMelee to watch me compete for $10,000! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è.
