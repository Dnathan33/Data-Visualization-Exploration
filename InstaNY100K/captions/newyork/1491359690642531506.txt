At the empty Mount McGregor Correctional Facility in upstate #NewYork, Florida businessman William Browning envisions an entertainment complex with a film studio, a concert venue and a theme park. William has a plan to redevelop the site, which has been closed since 2014, and the prison’s former state razor-topped fencing, century-old buildings and peeling paint are seen as an asset. “Zombies are something the market has become obsessed with,” he says. “We’ll dedicate an entire section of the property to scenarios where people can use survival tactics to dominate the world during a zombie apocalypse.” William’s enthusiasm is music to state officials’ ears as they strive to find new life for empty prisons scattered across New York, most of them in rural areas. @nathaniel_brooks_photo captured this scene while on #nytassignment at Mount McGregor Correctional Facility, one of 13 state prisons that @nygovcuomo has closed since 2011. cc nytimes
