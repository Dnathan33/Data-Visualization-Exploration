I decide to post a pic that would show a transformation from a month postpartum to today.  This took time and dedication during a very busy time in my life. Working out and my nutrition were crucial to losing 8.5% of my body fat. I am currently 12 pounds under my pre-baby weight.  I plan on continuing a healthy lifestyle and motivating myself and others. (85/15) What do these numbers mean? These are numbers I live by. üçã üçã #longevity #dietitian #dietitians #rd #rdchat #rdtobe #life #nj #njfoodie #nutrition #nutritious #nutritionist #food #workoutmotivation #workout #workouts #workingout #weightloss #weightlosstransformation #weightlossjourney #weightlosshelp #weightlifting #weights #lifetimefitness #vegetables #lifestyleblogger #lifestyle #newyork
