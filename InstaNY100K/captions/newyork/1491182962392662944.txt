Eataly had me at hello! Or should I say ciao ;) My first visit was at the opening of their Flatiron location in 2010! So much good Italian food in one place, what is there not to like? :) Now they have opened a second store, in Tribeca (in the new World Trade Center) and you can also find Eataly in several other countries, including Italy of course where it was founded 10 years ago. I love the little truck! Hope we get one of those to Eataly in Stockholm ðŸ›µðŸ˜Š#newyork #nyc #mywork #inspiration #meetings #tour #learning #eataly #eatalysthlm #openingsoon #italianfood #foodie #biblioteksstan #pr #communication #bielstenco
