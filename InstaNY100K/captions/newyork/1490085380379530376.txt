Working through the weekend on Wall Street with a single open day has not been easy, but the reproductive rights of women and girls are under attack and we need to stop agonizing amongst the forces of good, and start organizing accordingly. For too long we've been settling for reactive positions rather than having long term strategies to resist, fight and win as a global team and united compact for good! Unpack the power, allow the radicals in and move towards tangible impact because human rights, can't wait. 🌍🇿🇦✊🏾🇺🇸🗽 #Planning #Strategy #Srhr4All #RightToHealth #WorkHard #CivicDiplomacy #UnitedNations #SunnyDay #BrooklynBridge #GlobalGoals #TogetherWeWin #ThisIs22 #Resist #Persist #Fight #Winning #NewYork
