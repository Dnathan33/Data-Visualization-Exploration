As KP isn't likely to play tomorrow in the season finale, let's gonna take a look at his stats as a sophomore:  66 games (26-40)  18.1 PTS - 7.2 REBS - 1.5 ASTS - 0.7 STL - 2 BLO in 33 mins  45% FG, 36% 3s, 79% FT, 54% true shooting  12 doubles-doubles, 17.4 PER  Although he had impresive numbers, they are not that better than his rookie season. But he has been playing restricted a lot of time because of injuries and the dynamic of the team, so next season I will expect a huge improvement off him. And more after training this summer with the Swish41  #Knicks #NewYork #KristapsPorzingis #Knickstape #Nowitzki #NY #NBA
