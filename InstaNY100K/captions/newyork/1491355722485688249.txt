Shout out to everyone that came out last night to the 40/40 for Sheree Whitfield @shereewhitfield Cup Cakes and Champagne party.  It was a lot of bottle popping up in the building and a BUNCH of sexy ladies.  Awww man ole man. 😍  This Single Life is starting to feel good.  I'm starting not to feel lonely anymore.  Maybe it's the weather because I was in Eye Candy heaven last night.  If you missed it I'm sorry for you. 😂😂 I can't stop thinking about this Cutie in the all white.  She took the Cupcake last night. 😂😂😂 Don't forget to get Sheree book it's out now.  Make sure y'all go to iTunes and purchase that Tunnel documentary titled The Hip-Hop Nucleus: A documentary on the legendary Tunnel nightclub of NYC.  Classic legendary Hip-Hop.  #chokenojoke #shereewhitfield #rhoa #realhousewivesofatlanta #bravo #atlanta #barnesandnoble #newyorkcity #newyork #booksigning #timessquare #books #readers #whogoncheckmeboo #shebysheree #thetunneldocumentary #thehiphopnucleus #feelrich #healthnut #trainer #training #physicalfitness #gymrats #workout #4040club #sportsbar
