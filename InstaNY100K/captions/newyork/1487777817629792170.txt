So this is an actual photo of where we're headed on April 15th. And guess what? YOU CAN COME TOO! . . We still have spots left for our Be Love Yoga & Meditation Retreat in Tulum, Mexico (April 15-22) and we're having a last chance FLASH SALE at $300 off! . . There are non-stop flights from NY to Cancun for around $500 right now...not too bad. And aside from travel & "extras" like excursions or shopping, the retreat is all-inclusive. . . Let us know if you have any questions or visit https://mayatulum.com/retreats/ for more info :) @mayatulum
