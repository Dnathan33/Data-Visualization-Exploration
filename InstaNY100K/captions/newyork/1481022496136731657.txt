Day 29 - Production Assistant on Redlegs  A team from New York was in the Nati for 2 weeks filming Cincinnati-native Brandon Harris' new feature - and yes! It's even about Cincinnatians. Redlegs was the original name of the first national baseball team in the U.S. to ever register, but you won't see a whole lot of baseball here (although there is a scene at Great American Ball Park). Instead we're presented a gritty drama as black-on-black violence leave a group of friends reminiscing their time in Ohio and dealing with the loss of a good friend.  I was hired for 5 days as a production assistant. Some cast and crew I recognized (the guy who dies was played by my friend Gad Asher.) I had so much fun with these guys from New York and Cincinnati I even took some behind-the-scenes photos. Filming locations include Frisbee Golf (Disc Golf) at Burnett Woods (where His Name Is Walter was later shot), Northside and Alexandria, KY. The film showcases GCA favorites like the infamous ice cream shop UDF, and Skyline is even mentioned making the movie more nostalgic to me now having been home only once in 3 years since my move to Los Angeles.  Regarding production, I have done P.A. work for The Amazing Race 25, We Are Champions with MTV's David Lingwood, Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards and Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Sports Awards with plans to do plenty more leading to continuous work in camera, editing, writing, producing and directing.  Be sure to look for my name in the credits! Best wishes to Brandon Harris and the team on all their future work and thanks for giving me my first production assistant role.  You can buy Redlegs on DVD on Amazon or rent/buy a digital download.  #Redlegs #RedlegsMovie #RedlegsFilm #Cincinnati #Cincinnatifilm #NY #NewYork #NYC #BrandonHarris #UDF #Skyline #GreatAmericanBallPark #CincinnatiReds #drama #blackonblackviolence #death #setlife #PA #productionassistant #TrippyT #filmmaking #BurnettWoods #fireworks #indie #indiefilm #Amazon #40DaysOfSuccess #baseball #friendship #Ohio
