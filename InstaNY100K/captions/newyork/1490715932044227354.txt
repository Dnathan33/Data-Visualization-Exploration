Alex: "Last I read The Handmaid's Tale which is about a dystopian future where women have no rights. This book I'm reading purely for fun. I would say it's world mythology reimagined into a modern American context with a bunch of zany characters who are historical gods. When people first came to America they brought their Old World gods with them. Now the new gods, like technology and media, are emerging and are trying to kill the old gods. All of these gods are personified in the story and you can see how people worship them. I think we spend more time with technology than with anything else. I'm a social media producer and am on my computer basically all the time. I know I'm feeding the beast and am part of the problem. I wish people would spend more time on mastering a craft. I wish I'd spend more time on cooking or writing." @alexandrarmeier reading #AmericanGods by #NeilGaiman / @theubc for #subwaybookreview #newyork ðŸ—½
