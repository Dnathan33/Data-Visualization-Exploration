During college, if I  was taking six classes, and in three clubs, and working in the anatomy lab, AND tutoring, I was also house sitting for one of my professors.  She had two cats, one of which was diabetic and required daily injections, who had to be fed and given water and played with.  I saw it as a mini vacation from home AND I got paid for it - I also got to eat whatever was in the fridge, was was always well stocked, just one thing, ALWAYS ask about the brownies.  I found some in the freezer, I said ooooo, grabbed a few and a glass of milk.  Then I starred tripping.  Omg!!!
