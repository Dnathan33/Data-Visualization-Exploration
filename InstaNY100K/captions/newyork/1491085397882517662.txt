James wouldn't let us take photos or videos tonight, so of course I listened and obeyed! This photo was on the wall at work (still not sure why) and then I took it and had it on my desk for over a year. I'm so fucking happy I got to see LCD Soundsystem NOT at a festival, and it was even better because it was in New York. New York you're perfect, oh please don't change a thing. What an amazing show. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚úåüèªÔ∏è
