Williamsburg Bridge / My favorite New York bridge. First time I was in #nyc was in 1987. I saw the Yankees. We saw the sights but it was very different. Much grittier and dirty but very cosmopolitan. In 1997 my dear friend @thescumfrog immigrated here and I joined him to settle in. My sister @zoe_bp had an internship then too at #knoll  Since then I've been here about 15 times at least. But this time something has changed. Can't say exactly what it is. Too little space on insta to formalize. Empty shops/businesses. Old characteristic buildings down and new condos up. Still love it! But... #change #newyork
