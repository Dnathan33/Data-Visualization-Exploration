Today I had the most insightful conversation with the #artist of this #sketch @jongoparadise. He has #incredible #artwork that is filled with #beautiful #details. While talking with him, I saw his #passion for his #work and #craft. Besides his #blackandwhite #landscape #sketching he does pieces of #art that are #colorful (and #loving in the third piece). He also lives on a #boat! Truly fascinating, philosophical, and #talented #soul. I'm #happy I got to meet him and #lucky that he took the time to #converse with me. Not to mention how #kind and #nice he was to me! Come to Union Square and #buy this #artforsale!! #nyc #newyork #newyorkcity #forsale #promo
