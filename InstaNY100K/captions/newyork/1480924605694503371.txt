Opening day at the #artforo I had a great time, it was cool... the interesting part about this picture is that music took me to perform where #malcolmx got assassinated On February 21, 1965 this place was once called "The Audubon Ballroom"... I wonder if anybody knew that tonight, but hey I sang my music here and I guess that's enough for me.  Tomorrow I get to do it all over again come down and say hi. #ea #emiantonio #emiantoniomusic #emiantoniotrio #amiga #pensandoenti #nofuefacil #esporti #soledad #newyork
