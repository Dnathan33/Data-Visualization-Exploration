One year yesterday Dad passed away and not a day goes by I don't think about him and the good times we had together. He still keeps me on my feet everyday with different challenges to over come with out him or with out him teaching me how to fix it. Miss you and love you always R.I.P Dad #rip  #dad #ripdad #rap #rapper #musiclife #music #newmusic #nextup #buffalo #onebuffalo #newyork #ghp #greenhouseproject  #sodmg #gang  #boss #motivated #allthisgold #hiphop #gooddyeyoung #love #missyou #supporter
