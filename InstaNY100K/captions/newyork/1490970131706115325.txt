Just ate at #pjclarkes After 45 minutes waiting we got an almost cold burger, an goat cheese salad without the goat cheese and a Shepard pie. The manager came by and said it was way less of a waiting time, though we had timed it and he refused to applogized. I do not recommend this place, though we had high hopes. #newyorkcity #newyork #dissapponted #Irish pub
