Sweet Dory is a 1-year old Shep/Lab/Pit mix, only 25lbs, and found herself at a high kill shelter with a terrible case of non-contagious mange. She's mostly hairless on her belly and her red raging skin is now calming and healing - thanks to the top notch medical care at our San Antonio Vet partner! Dory is ready to make the long trip to NY from Texas and will arrive on Saturday, but she needs a home to go to!! She is great with kids, dogs, and cats. Will you help Dory?
