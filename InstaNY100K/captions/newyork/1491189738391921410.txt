â–º Queens, New York.  The most ethnically diverse region that i've ever seen - i love that. In Queens, you will find Korean kids who sound like black kids. Italians who sound like Puerto Ricans. Puerto Ricans who sound like Italians. Third-generation Irish who sound like old Jews. That's Queens.  #newyork #queens #travel #traveller #travelgram #travelphotography #queensbridge #nofilter  #nofilterneeded  #instagood #instadaily #oneworld #noracism #colorful #newyorkinspired
