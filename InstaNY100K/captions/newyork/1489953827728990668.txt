One of my favorite makeup scenes from "White Face" film, which just premiered this weekend at the Ashland Independent Film Festival (@ashlandfilm). This movie meant a lot to me as it speaks of our political climate and injustice towards races. I am so grateful director Mtume Gant had me part of an amazing film. . #makeup#mua#white#face#film#independent#festival#blacklives#artislouderthanwords#art#fighting#society#beauty#political#newyork#nyc#brooklyn#madeinNY#trucco#truccatrice#fun#character#crying#pain#sadness
