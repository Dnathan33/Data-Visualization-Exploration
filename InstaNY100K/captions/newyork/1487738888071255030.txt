Took this picture from a motorway the other day. The New York skyline standing tall from the contributions of past generations. The gravestones tell us who they were. This incredible city is a legacy of their hard work. #newyork #nyc #thisiswhyishouldntwriteartblurbs #skyline #instadaily #instaphoto #takenfromthecar #takenfromiphone #motivation #usa  #itsanotherpintimwantin
