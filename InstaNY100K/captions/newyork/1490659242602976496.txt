Brooklyn is like a big outdoor art museum & this was definitely the best piece of art that I saw yesterday.  Why???ğŸ¤” because it's some sort of metallic substance & it's see through. By using hundreds of these pieces intertwined spaciously you get a cheese grater effect but instead of having holes this bad boy is filled all types of shapes & is heavily detailed.  I can only imagine how long and how tedious it was to create this horse.  Clap it up for the artist tho. ğŸ˜€ğŸ˜€ğŸ˜€ Caught my eye.  #redhook #brooklyn #nyc #newyork #art #horse #toyota #truck #trucks #streetart #bk
