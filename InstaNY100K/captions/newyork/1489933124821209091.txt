"TT: Have you been influenced by any culture that is not your own? If so which one and how?⠀ ⠀ GGR: I have lived in Harlem for over a decade and there is a sizable Senegalese and Ivorian population and I can’t help but be influenced by the vibrant colors and patterns the men and women wear. Those textiles have made it into the shirts that I make and that color sensibility has made it into my prints as well." ⠀ ⠀ Stop by the  BLOG on our website traveltherapytours.org for more from  our interview "INSIDE THE MIND OF AN MEXICAN-AMARICÓN" with the amazing @gbrlgrcrmn ! ⠀ ⠀ #art #Mexican #Chicago #NewYork #latino #art #inspiration #queer #lbgtq #artists #supportartists #Harlem #textiles #Senegalese #Africa
