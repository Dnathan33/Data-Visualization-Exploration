Whether fast or slow, If only I could know you. So every way I feel apart of something like you always do.  Yet again You're my sanctuary How and when that a greatness eternally does come along  Wherever I stand You're the one Who'll be right there with me Wherever I land You're the one Who'll be there to break my fall.  #Taproot #WhereverIStand #HeyArnold #Love #Caring #Compassion #brooklyn #NewYork
