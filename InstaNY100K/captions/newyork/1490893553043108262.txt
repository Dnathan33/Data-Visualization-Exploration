Track session tonight, last one before #londonmarathon. 3x 400+1k // 400, 800, 400, 400. Around 5:40/mi average pace although forgot to stop watch on one of the laps! Last two 400s in 65 secs - fine tuning hurts! Pic is from when I did a speed sesh a few weeks ago at East River Track #newyork #fitness #workout #athletics #circuittraining
