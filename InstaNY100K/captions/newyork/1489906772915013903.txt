It's going down this Friday! The long awaited taste of Turks & Caicos style Good Friday buns with a side of good cheese. If you want the recipe just check the blog and start from Wednesday! I'll be experimenting with a bread machine version this year since I will only be eating 2 buns maximum (gotta stay Lit & Fit for Carnival in Jamaica). Enjoy! •••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••• #TingzNice #GoodFridayBuns #BunRecipe #EasterIsComing #CountdownToJACarnival  #TCIFoodAndCulture #FeteAfterFete
