Your president. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ The U.S. military, under the orders of President Trump, fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Shayrat Air Base on Thursday night, or Friday morning in Syria. The attack was in response to a sarin gas attack officials say Syrian President Bashar Assad launched that killed more than 70 civilians.  The decision to take military action against Assad is a dramatic escalation in U.S. involvement in the 6-year-old civil war, which the U.S. military has never directly intervened in. It was also a notable departure for Trump, who has said he didn't want to pull the U.S. deeper into the conflict. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ #war #Assad #Russia #Iran #China #military #ResistTrump #LosAngeles #NotMyPresident  #Chicago #Trump  #NewYork #NYC #Miami  #WashingtonDC #CNN #AndersonCooper #DC #FoxNews #Resist #Syria #SyriaStrikes #Army #Navy #Marines #AirForce #America #American #UnitedStates #US
