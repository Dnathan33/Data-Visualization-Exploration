On Location in Poughkeepsie...with #MarkWilson. #FBF - We were actors in New York when, "Whatever Happened to Kathy", was shot.  I meet Mark years before through one of my BFF's #StacyChbosky. -  We took the train 🚂 from NYC up to Poughkeepsie.  This was my third film...I was so excited and so nervous. - I'm not sure what happened with this film by Chris Kane...but I know this was the beginning of my life long love affair with film work.💌 - Dreams do come true.  It's not easy or pretty all of the time, but they do!📽 - #Actor #Actress #whichisit ❓❓ #Actorslife
