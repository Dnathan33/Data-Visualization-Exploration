I talked to you through wavelengths and I can hear the smile in your voice. You reminded me how a 5 minute phone call would lead us to our favorite local spot to indulge in matters over coffee aromas. You reminded me how nomadic I have become over the years, how you lived vicariously through me. You reminded me how much of an impact I made and how much more I am capable of. You reminded me how time and time again, I am the person I was meant to be, so gracious in the words that jumped off that tongue of yours. • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • • #sipthis #coffeelover #coffee #veganfriends #veganfriendly #newyork #nyc #ny #local #vs #li #life #bestfriends #coffeehouse #art #arthouse #prose
