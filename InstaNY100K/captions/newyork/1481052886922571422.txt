Here's a glimpse at some of the new pieces exhibited from tomorrow at The Photography Show presented by @aipadphoto in New York pier 94 until 2nd April. You can see my work at stand 218 with @desotogallery and at stand 801 with @thephotographersgallery say hello to Shelly (de Soto) and Anthony (photog gallery) for me! Sad I can't make it. . . . . . #cosmicsurgery #instagood #creative #aipad #photography #photographycollector #origami #portraiture #newwork #newyork #exhibition #art
