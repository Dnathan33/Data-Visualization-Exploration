Happy Friday Instagram! Didn't get the chance to post it on Tuesday. This is a job that we did in Long Island. We dont don't do it that often, but also offer our clients a option of refacing your stairs. The whole process is that we cut the nosing of existing staircase. Clean the treads and riser from any debris. In this case we had to take out the carpet and make sure that there were no nails or staples are sticking out. Install 1/2 plywood for the stringers. Put the treads in between and top them of with 1/2 risers. What made me posts this is that - its so awesome to see how fast the staircase is looking completely different and fresh and new. I don't have the picture of the completed project but it took us 6 hours to strip the carpet out, and do all the cleaning and at the end of the day we almost finished tye first staircase. PS: almost forgot. Last picture. The wall "lean back" a little bit :) but we did pull it back. #dkpstairsandrailing #efficiency #anotherdayanotherstaircase #refacing #staircaserefacing #redoak #redoaktreads #redoakrisers #redoakstringer #longisland #nassaucounty #suffolkcounty #newyork #mtsinay #followus
