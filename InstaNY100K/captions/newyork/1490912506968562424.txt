Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis at a book fair at The Plaza Hotel in New York City on April 1, 1977 ⎯ "She was always reading! That’s the image I have when I think of her. In New York, she’d be reading when I came home from school or in the evenings. In the summer, we’d swim in the mornings, and in the afternoons she’d read on the porch. She always said that reading the memoirs of Versailles was the best preparation she had for the White House, because the way people behaved at court was like how they did around the president. She had a deep engagement with literature, history, plays, and poetry. They gave her strength, even in the difficult times." ~ Caroline Kennedy talking about her mother in an interview with PARADE about Jaqueline Kennedy: Historic Conversations on Life with John F.
