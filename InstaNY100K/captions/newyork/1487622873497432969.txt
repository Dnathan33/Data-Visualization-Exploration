Ever since the first time I stepped onto Times Square 4 years ago I've been amazed every time. New York is without a doubt one of my favorite places in the world, and even tho I've been here 5 times since - It never seems to stop taking my breath away. ‚ù§Ô∏è oh! And look at the billboard for "Ricks Cafe" in Negril, Jamaica too!
