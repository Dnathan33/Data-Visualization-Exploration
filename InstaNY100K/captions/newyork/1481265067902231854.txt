DHPSNY offers free educational programs to qualifying New York institutions! Our workshops promote interactive learning, networking, and collaboration, and DHPSNY staff travels to deliver them at locations in every part of the state. Here's Program Coordinator Anastasia Matijkiw delivering our first workshop, last fall's Understanding Archives, at Crandall Public Library in Glens Falls. We just added three new workshop topics presented at 15 locations across New York between now and the end of the year!
