I'm thrilled to be curating a show of Todd Webb's post-war NYC street photography. The show runs from April 20 to May 20; the opening is on the 19th at 6pm at the @thecuratorgallery in Chelsea. Webb, who was friends with O'Keeffe, Stieglitz, Gordon Parks, Berenice Abbott, was a true master. Please swing by.  @toddwebbarchive #streetphotography #newyork @historicnyc #blackandwhite
