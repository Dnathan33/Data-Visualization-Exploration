A unique landscaping technique!  #Repost @parametric.architecture with @repostapp ・・・ (Snapchat: #paarchitecture ) LIVING PAVILION Behin Ha's "Living Pavilion" was selected as the winner of the "City of Dreams" design/build architectural pavilion for the 2010 summer season on Governors Island.  After the competition phase of the project, the Pavilion's form was reconceptualized to meet new site and budgetary requirements.  With the help of the sponsoring organizations (FIGMENT, ENYA, & SEAoNY) and a team of consultants and volunteers, Behin and Ha built Living Pavilion on the Parade Grounds at Governors Island.
