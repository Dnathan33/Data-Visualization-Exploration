Day three. Niagara Falls. As I mentioned previously, the famous maid in the mist no longer exist but the same service is still here. We took an unforgettable trip on the Hornblower to witness nature's most incredible sight up close. That's it for pics in and around the falls; but, as you will see later, it won't be their last appearance on this account thanks to our hotel. #niagarafalls #Ontario #Canada #tourofcanada #whcanada2016 #holiday #hornblower #maidinthemist #boat #waterfall #usa #unitedstates #newyork #horseshoefalls #rainbow #water #sunglasses #perfectday #bestplaceonearth #7wonders #7wondersoftheworld #sevenwonders
