Three years ago I left Ohio! I spent a week on a friends couch in Saint Louis, then Arlington, ny, back to Arlington and then home to oz. Within that three years I went back to school and graduated with a Bachelor of Youth Work and now finalising another visa to move back to America for a year. So much can happen in three years! #life#change #changes #uni #degree #melbourne #australia #dc #arlington #newyork #love#light #traveller #wanderlust #imneverlost #heart #friends#family
