This is the first look I took at New York yesterday afternoon (not counting airport and subway ride). It instantly got me. I took this picture so I can always come back to that first time. After all the years of saying I don't want to go.. Well played New York, well played. ðŸ¤”ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ #youcansayitoldyousonow #nyc #howdoistoptime #newyork #explore #travel #catchmeifyoucan #notasandcastleking
