We are deeply saddened by the passing of the I Have A Dream Foundation Founder, Eugene Lang (pictured in the center) on  April 8th at the age of 98. Mr. Lang made Dreamers out of all of us, and we are honored to carry on his tremendous vision and legacy in Colorado! ðŸ“· from 1985 by Chester Higgins, @nytimes
