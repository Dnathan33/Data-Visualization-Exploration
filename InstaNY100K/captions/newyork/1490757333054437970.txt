√Å #souvenir of an #abcdoodle from when @darryl.cunningham was in #nyc with me. We went to @fondanyc one night & were seated next to the most #oldschool people ever- you could cut their accents with a knife! And their clothes- def #1980s ! It appeared to be 2 couples (perhaps related?) who were old friends having a birthday celebration. Since this #pinkhaired & #pink outfitted lady refused to let the other couple pay. It felt like a #snapshot into #oldnewyork  Okay drawing break over- gonna grab some more #coffee & get back to #werk ... ... #drawnbyme In #alphabetcity #newyork #sketch #sketchysketch former #noogadoodle #margarita #ontherocks #lime #mexicancuisine #happyhour #hairclip #pinktastic #statenisland
