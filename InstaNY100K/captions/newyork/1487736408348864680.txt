This place is definitely​ a hidden gem in NY. I'm glad we found this 1906 library, which holds the world's rarest books and manuscript, (including Jane Austen's, Shakespeare's, Mozart's and Einstein's), as well as collection of prints and drawings. It was perfect for a rainy, cold day in the city. 📚☕🌧️☔😍 #bookstagram #books #library #museum #booklover #janeausten #shakespeare #einstein #mozart #ny #nyc #newyorkcity #newyorknewyork #newyork #newyorker #iloveny #usa #american #americanstyle #travelphotography #travel #wanderlust #wonderful_places #beautifuldestinations #aroundtheworld #neverstopexploring #ig_captures #instatravel #travelblogger #traveller
