2nd version #wip of @cs_stretchmusic collab for @harlemartsfest exhibit with @realmusicrebels coming April 13th. ------------------------------------------------- The portrait contains the track list for Christian Scott a Tunde Adluah's "Stretch Music" Album. The colors in the face representing royalty as well as the colors of New Orleans where Christian is from. Within the face is another portrait of him playing his trumpet (turn clockwise 90 degrees and see the shape as it "stretches" over his face). The background includes Lee Morgan's sheet music for "Sidewinder", another track inspiring me during this process, but also a representation of an older generation of Jazz that pushed the boundaries of this genre, however according to Christian's bio, can have a difficult time understanding the idea & purpose of Stretch Music. Within the sheet music are also cityscapes of Harlem & New Orleans further representing Jazz, this exhibit & Christian's home. And to close it out, each section of the portrait is a strip from a different portrait of him to express the cubism style of art he has discussed while explaining the style that is Stretch Music. #layers
