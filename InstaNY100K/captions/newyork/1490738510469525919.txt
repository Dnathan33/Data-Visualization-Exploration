Thrilled to share that the 2017 @jeffreyfashioncares benefit raised more than $800,000 to benefit the work of the Elton John AIDS Foundation, the Hetrick-Martin Institute and Lambda Legal!!! Thank you to everyone who gave their talent, time and money to these amazing organizations! Until next year's main event 🌈🏳️‍🌈🌈 📸: @kevintachman
