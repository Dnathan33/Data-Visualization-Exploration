Happy birthday to not only ATCQ but to the #mpc smooth jazz Rhythmest that caught me with his laid back tongue flow on songs like #ohmygod #wegotthejazz and the dopest way to set up another artist on a smooth beat. I mean #checktherhime "I'll be the sender.." had me thinking of so many ways to change up lines. Always made me use the term "Sukka nigga" man what else can I say but , Ima make you proud on some. #newyork #beats  #instrumentals #wheretheproducersat  #producers #atribecalledquest #atcq #qtip
