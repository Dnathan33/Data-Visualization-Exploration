While waiting for this fake candid to be taken of me admiring the spectacular view from 700+ ft up while the wind blew thru my paj√≥n, all I could think about was that scramble up the mountain so far and how challenging it was, but yet, despite my own apprehension, I made it. It was in that moment that I realized how out of shape I am and should really start working out. Went from beginner to expert real quick. Those stretches at the beginning did not help at all. But I did it, all 1,200+ft and back down and it was awesome. You should try it. So, how was your Tuesday? #breakneckridge #hiking #newyork #coldspring #thegreatoutchea
