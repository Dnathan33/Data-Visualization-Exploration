Happy Friday! I am so excited to be raising funds for @teamforkids for the third year. In celebration of recent donations, I wanted to do a special shoutout to those who continue to support me in this fundraising journey. Huge thank you to one of my best friends, college roommate of 2 years, professional mover who assisted my transition to NYC.. the one and only Bethany Weeks. We met on a trip called Washington Youth Tour, the summer after my junior year of high school. We quickly found out we'd both be attending Governor's Scholar Program at Morehead University for 5 weeks that summer following the youth tour. We were quickly inseparable. Bethany is one who has been there through all the big moments in my life. I'll never forget when I lost my dad, Bethany (along with some other amazing humans) helped pack up my whole dorm room for the summer when I didn't return. Without asking or pushing, she always has a way of supporting you. Smart and talented, Bethany continues to have such an impact on the lives of the kids she's teaching. Bethany I love you and have so much fun when you're here in NYC. Thank you for always being you.. through the years and miles, I know I can always count on you. Xo.
