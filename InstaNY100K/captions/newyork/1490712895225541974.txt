Some times it is ok to get caught up in the storm. The world looks different amidst the turmoil. . So it's Tuesday again and that means it's another round of #Two_For_Tuesdays reflection shots. . Yes, I'm still on this. It forces me to think about shots and get away from your typical @instagram type shots. Creating while playing, if you will. . This time around, I have to admit, this shot almost didn't make it today. Why you ask? Cause I had itchy fingers and almost pulled the trigger and posted it. It was taken last week during that freakish little storm that later surprised me with a rainbow. . By this point, the skies were opening, the rainbow was gone, and this young lady was walking around taking photos. Of course, I saw a shot and had to ask if she would pose for me. BOOM! . . #nycprimeshot #ig_nycity #usaprimeshot #what_i_saw_in_nyc #newyork_instagram #esb #loves_nyc #icaputer_NYC #instagramnyc #nycdotgram #newyork_ig #newyorkcitylife #made_in_ny #ilovenyc #nyc_explorers #topnewyorkphoto #instagood #canonphotography #photooftheday #ig_shotz #colors_of_day #hubs_united #superhubs #ig_exquisite #greatshotz #nycskyline #illgrammers #igs_america #ig_all_americas
