LIFE ON HOLD - 2015 - Handcarved 3ft x20" - I was at the bar trying to figure out a design to express this amazing time in my life that I was calling "LIFE ON HOLD" . As I stared at my last dollar the design was right there. LIFE ON HOLD is the living in the moment/when nothing exists except true happiness.
