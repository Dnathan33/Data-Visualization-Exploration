Boathouse restaurant inside Central Park reminded me of Boathouse club in #Nainital, India.. a quaint and beautiful hill station located in the mountains of the north .. it was my every summer vacation destination as a child (as my aunt lived there and that's what you do at that age)  Almost every evening all the cousins and elders would visit the boat house club.. the children would sing and dance to live music while the elders would drink and try their hand at poker .. life was sweet and simple then ❤️️ I sometimes do wish I could grow up once again 💞  #boathouseclub #boathouseclubnainital #centralpark #newyork #nainitaldiaries❤ #reminiscing #warmsummerday #hellospring #dejavu #nainital #childhoodlove #newyorking
