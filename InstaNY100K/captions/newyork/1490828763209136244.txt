I am always so grateful at the end of the day for how loyal my clients are to me. This beautiful client of mine flew into NYC just to pay me a visit. She had her first Microblading appointment with me. I did a very natural soft tap & feather stroke effect to her brow. Nothing makes me more happy then when I see my clients selfies & there feeling amazing about themselves 🙌🏻💞😁 #microblading#semipermanenteyebrows#softtap#brows#newyork#newjersey#outtastate#browsonfleek#browgame#tattoo#skinguru#browspecialist#featherstroke#feelingpretty#happyclient#estheticianlife#thankful
