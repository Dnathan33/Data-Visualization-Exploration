It's our #birthday! @blujamcafe turns 11 years old today!  It's amazing how time flies, and how much has happened over the years. We had a humble start, and today, we have four locations in #LosAngeles, with two more coming, plus one in #Tokyo.  Thanks to everyone who came from near and far, from #Hollywood to #NewYork to #India to #Japan. Thanks for all the wonderful memories and for all the laughs and good times.  We could not have done it without you, our Blu Jam family! Cheers to another 11 years with you all. . . . . #chef #chefkamil #cheflife #chefsofinstagram #behindtheknife #kitchenlife #restaurantlife #cookingram #cookingwithlove #cookingisfun #inspiration #livingthedream #foodie #foodlovers #cuisine #finedining #losangelesfoodie #laeats #goodeats #calilove #gratitude
