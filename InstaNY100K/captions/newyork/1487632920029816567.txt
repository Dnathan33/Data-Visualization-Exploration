I am just SO excited to be heading back to New York soon and see my beautiful cousin @alanyagreen walk down the aisle and marry her love. There is nothing greater on this earth, from New York to Temora than love. And more than ever currently, the world needs more love, more connection and more humanity ‚ù§ . . . . . . #newyork #justlove #marriage #excited #family #travel #travelbug #life #love #respect #humanity #gypsygirlbeauty #holiday #fun #nyc
