Cheers to @downtown_native on national sister day! I am so incredibly lucky to have in my life such a beautiful person, both inside and out. Sis, you're my mentor and my motivation in so many ways. I so value your advice and opinions, and I also love that you frequently come to me for my thoughts on things. We weren't always very close, but I'm so happy with where we're at now, and that I know I always have my sister at my side to share the good times and endure the difficult ones. Love you! ðŸ’•
