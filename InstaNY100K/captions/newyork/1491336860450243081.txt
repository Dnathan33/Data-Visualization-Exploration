Thai Massage is all about a deep listening of your receivers body. Moving slowly and mindfully is where it's at. One of the students yesterday had a great analogy: When you enter your own bedroom, chances are that you know where the light switch is with your eyes closed. If you rush in with your eyes closed, no matter how well you know your room, you might stub your toe or knock something over and it all "goes to sh*t". I'm so honored to share space with these amazing people and teachers. . ðŸ“¸ @climbwadeharder . . @justincaruso @jasonnemer @acro_babe  @yogimnastic Tamara, Nunu, Niko, and everyone else who I've met here! #medellinacroyogaprimavera #thaimassage #thailove #acroyoga #acro #yoga #thaimassage #acrobaticyoga #partneryoga #igethighwithalittlehelpfrommyfriends #acrolove #love #play #thebestthingever #hudsonvalley #newpaltz #rhinebeck #woodstock #kingston #chester #mohonk #ny #newyork #hudsonvalleyyoga #hudsonvalleyguide  #getgutsy @acroyoga
