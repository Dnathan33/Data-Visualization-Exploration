LEARNING FROM BIG MISTAKES - 53 Orchard Street - open today from 3-7pm:⠀ Nilbar Güreş CEMİLE IS CALLING from the series Open Phone Booth, 2011, is inspired by observations and experiences in one of the Alevi-Kurdish villages in Bingöl, still deprived of basic infrastructural elements such as roads, water, and telephones. The photographs become a portrait of the villagers who, in order to use the cell phones, go up to the hills to be within the “reception area.” The villagers seek a high enough point with good reception around the village to connect with the outside world; going up and down, they share with us their troubles, their anxiety to celebrate the holidays, or their moments of connecting with their loved ones.⠀ #nilbargures #open #phonebooth #learningfrombigmistakes #galerietanjawagner #53orchard #newyork #artthatkeepsusgoing⠀
