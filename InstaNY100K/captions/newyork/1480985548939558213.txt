A few weeks back I had the pleasure of working as a model with @photographer_ericgarciamarch - for this picture, I spent a few hours being wrapped in plastic (it was really weird, and really awesome) while holding my Dad's vintage @martinguitar...with a rather troubled look on my face. Sometimes, this is exactly how a troubador feels when they're on vacation. #guitar #guitarist #guitarra #art #photography #blackandwhite #artist #photographer #bahamas #martin #martinguitar #acoustic #paradise #model #fashion #photoshoot #photooftheday #ericgarciamarch #brooklyn #newyork #newyorkcity #nyc #queens #longisland #latenight  #music #musician #williamsburg #bushwick
