Minus The Bear were ok. Had their moments when it was cool and there were times when I thought it was a bit slow. The biggest thing I take home from their show was how Jake's vocals sounded exactly like the record. He's got a real good voice. #minusthebear #websterhall #livemusic #nyc #newyork #ny #alternativemusic
