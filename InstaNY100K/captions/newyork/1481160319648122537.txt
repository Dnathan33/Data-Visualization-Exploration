So I'm almost finished with my first book "The Secrets Of The Magical Moon Crystal". It's a children's book that makes you wonder.....after all, that's the point right? The story is about a young boy who friend's a reincarnated tree and makes friends with little spritz including a small creature from the Milky Way Galaxy...together, they fight the evil forces to protect a magic moon rock from the Deadly Denise, an aged witch who poisons animals to remain youthful. 🙌🏼 The story takes place in an enchanted island just off the South Pacific. The most exiting part for me was naming all the characters and bringing life to them, choosing what they look like and what cloths they wear.....that way the illustrations can be perfect! 😏🙌🏼❤️🌎💥 #author #writersofinstagram #childrensbooks #bookstagram #booksoninstagram #magicbook #losangeles #hawaii #milkyway #art #artist #artsy #triumph #news #newyork 🌳 Among the characters are Neptuno, Fahrenheit, Troll, Valentine & Tarpit 🚶🏼☄️📘
