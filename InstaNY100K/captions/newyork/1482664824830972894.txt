Ever since I was a kid, I knew the value in jumping on an idea as soon as I got the idea. It's only since becoming an adult that I notice we stop ourselves with thoughts of doom and gloom instead of building ourselves with the idea of abundance and prosperity. Let's remember our fearless child selves and push ourselves past our limitations. Those self-limiting beliefs don't exist - they're all in your mind. And remember that we change and grow with experience, so you need to add things to your life that will make you feel alive!!
