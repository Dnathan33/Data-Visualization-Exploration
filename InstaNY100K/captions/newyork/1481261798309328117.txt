It's Women's History Month, a time to recognize influential women and their contributions to history, culture and society.  Hillary Clinton is one of the most successful female politicians in US history. She has served as secretary of state, U.S. senator from New York, first lady of the United States, first lady of Arkansas, and of course, the first female presidential nominee. Today, she continues campaigning against gender inequality and most recently spoke at a sold-out San Francisco conference. ðŸ–Œ:@bi_graphics  For more on Hillary Clinton, visit BusinessInsider.com.  #HillaryClinton #Clinton #hillary #WomensHistoryMonth #women #history #influencialwomen #influence #inspiring #wcw #motivationwednesday #culture #society #female #politics #politicians #USA #America #secretaryofstate #senator #NewYork #NY #Arkensas #presidentialnominee #democrats
