"Stories you read when you're the right age never quite leave you. You may forget who wrote them or what the story was called. Sometimes you'll forget precisely what happened, but if a story touches you it will stay with you, haunting the places in your mind that you rarely ever visit." - Neil Gaiman.  @m____________________._ abbiamo un patto noi. ðŸŒŸðŸ—½ #thisisnewyorkcity #nyc #love #eat #drink #fun #newyork #newyorker #newyorkcity #friends #italians #bestmoment #brunch #sunday #loveamerica #lovenewyork
