Despite the fact that I'm an enormous nerd for getting excited about this EVERY TIME I WALK BY, this actually IS a pretty #cool #landmark #building with an #amazing #history. It's one of 15 attached #houses that made up the original #Yorkville (the sign outside says between 1661 & 1865??).... it's on 78th #street, around the corner from #lexingtonave ðŸŒƒ So that's a gorgeous lil bit of #newyork #history right there for ya. #NYC #uppereastside #architecture #architecturephotography #architectureporn #streetstyle #streetphotography #afternoon #delight #discovery #travel #travelphotography #beauty #beautiful #beautifuldestinations #wanderlust #wanderliving #love ðŸ’•
