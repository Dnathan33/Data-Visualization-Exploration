Margaret Martha Vanderhoff Roe (pictured in about 1874) was a wife and mother of ten. She and her husband Daniel were living in one of the family's old houses, when she suddenly became very ill. Her son John drove to Finley, about twelve miles distance, as there was no doctor in Caton then. The doctor came with him. After he examined her and talked with Daniel, it was discovered that when her children were born, she had taken arsenic in small does to relieve the pain. This had stayed in her stomach and now was poisoning her to death. He couldn't save her life, so he gave her some opiate for pain and to make her unconscious. She passed away at 4:00 am the following morning. She was 70 years of age when she passed away in late December 1900.
