Camille Corot. The letter. 1865. This painting is reminiscent of the expressive detail and delicate character of the Dutch painting, specifically Vermeer and de Hooch, whose works Corot might have seen during his trip to Holland in 1854. The period of the canvas might also point to a certain revival of interest in Vermeer's art in France. #art #modernart #painting #classicalart #metropolitan #gallery #nyc #collector #fineartgallery #newyork
