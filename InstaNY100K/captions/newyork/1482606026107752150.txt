Every day we see products that we love, so this #followfriday we want to take a moment to stop and meet the fabulous makers behind these items! There are so many talented artists and artisans out there, but here are just a few favorites. In the spirit of Follow Friday, go through and follow everyone on this list and then we'll follow you back! Once you've followed everyone on this list, commentsomething you saw on one of our pages or shops that you absolutely loved! Who knows, maybe you'll find a little treat for yourself along the way ðŸ˜‰  @moonlight_mama_shop @lalexandradesigns @smashedcereal @charmeddaisies @gabellare @twinmomapproved @southeasterncuties @luxuryletter @beadtreasuresbylori @sayitwithyarn @the_black_unicorn23 @myhiddenessentials @jennylovesglitterco @alchemybathco @essential_spirit @stickerpaperinc . . . . . . #meetthemakers #shopsmallbusiness #shophandmade #supporthandmade #createeveryday #livecreatively #makersgonnamake #mycreativebiz #meetthemaker #makesomething #creativehappylife #f4f #buyhandmade #handmadeisbetter #handmadewithlove #etsyshop #etsyseller #etsyfinds #handmade #creatorslane #welovehandmade #makersmovement #wearethemakers #creativelifehappylife #handsandhustle #huntinghandmades #handmadegifts #fashionblogger #instantbossclub
