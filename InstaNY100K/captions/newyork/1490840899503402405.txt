I took this photo kinda randomly when I was just checking my camera settings... Turned out to be one of my favorite pictures from our weekend trip to NYC as for me it captures the different things you can see in this area. These things that all together create that unique vibe. ðŸ˜Ž @andrewprousalis #goodtimes in #nyc
