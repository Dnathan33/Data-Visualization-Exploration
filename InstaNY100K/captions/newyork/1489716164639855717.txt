There were lots of stunning and amazing pieces on view @midcentury_modern show but this was one of my favourites. A great piece which could be adopted into any habitat. It's nice to see sideboards, chests of drawers, chairs and much more but pieces like this scream style!! #mcm #midcentury #midcenturymodern #midcenturyliving #midcenturydesign #retro #interiordesign #interiorstyling #interiorideas #interior #home #homedecor #homestyling #rosewood #london #paris #berlin #stockholm #copenhagen #newyork #sanfrancisco #style #iconic20thcentury
