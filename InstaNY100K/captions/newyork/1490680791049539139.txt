I got to perform some new songs I am working on last week for my latest solo pbroject. I can’t wait to see how these start to develop! I just wanted to share some songs I’m experimenting. Make sure you check out these other amazing composers. Their songs were simply incredible and definitely  setting the stage for the future of musical theater!  It’s wonderful that there are places out there to workshop materials that aren’t quite yet done, but could really benefit from a live audience! Play light Theatre is a great company that is very enthusiastic about supporting works in development, and I’m truly excited for them to host a reading of one of my new plays as well!  https://amyoes.com/2017/04/11/songwriters/ #music #songwriters #musicaltheatre #theatre #composer #theatre #newyork #theatrewomen
