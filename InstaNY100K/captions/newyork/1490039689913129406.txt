Currently planning my next trip with these tiny tourists. Back to Europe this summer to visit family and friends and do a little travel adventuring, of course. ðŸ™Œ Isabelle has been talking about visiting Paris for almost a year now so we will definitely be heading there. (Not that I need a reason to take my travel happy 3-year-old to one of my favourite cities. ðŸ‘Œ) Thinking of doing Paris AND another area in France - what are your favourite spots? I've only ever been to Paris and Nice. Thinking Provence or Loire Valley. Would love to hear from any France experts out there!
