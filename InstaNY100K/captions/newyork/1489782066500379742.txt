Yesterday's Sunday Funday wine tasting @grandvinhoboken 🍷in #Hoboken with my cousin from across the pond. 🇬🇧 She's the assistant director for @groundhogdaybwy which has made its way from #London to the states, so staying in #NYC for a few weeks while it's in previews and opens. I can't wait to see the play, and couldn't be happier to have her here. ❤️ #dontsithome #family
