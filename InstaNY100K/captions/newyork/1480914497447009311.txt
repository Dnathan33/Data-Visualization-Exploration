So tonight I saw my first ever production of Sweeney Todd! I was a bit nervous cos of my random dislike of necks, and total fear of seeing them sliced open, but @sweeneytoddnyc was perfect! The cast were incredible & of course @jeremysecomb was just outstandingly brilliant, yet terrifying at the same time! After years of loving the music so much, I'm so glad I finally saw this amazing production! ❤🎭🔪 #Broadway #OffBroadway #BarrowStreetTheatre #NYC #NewYork #SweeneyTodd #Musical #Theatre #Theater #AttendTheTale
