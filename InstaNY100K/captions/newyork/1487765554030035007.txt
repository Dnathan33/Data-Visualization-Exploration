It's been 925 days since Zack Wheeler last threw a major league pitch. For some perspective, @metscenter was 10 days old. Tonight, Wheeler makes his return as the Mets open up a weekend series with the Marlins at Citi Field.  Miami is an opponent that Wheeler has flat out dominated in his young career. In six lifetime starts against the Marlins, Wheeler is 2-0 with a 1.37 ERA. The East Paulding, Georgia, native's best game in the majors came against the Marlins, when he tossed a complete-game shutout on eight strikeouts and faced one over the minimum on June 19, 2014. Wheeler's last start was on Sept. 25, 2014 in Washington, when he threw five innings  and surrendered three runs against the Nationals. Wheeler underwent Tommy John Surgery that following March and missed the entirety of the 2015 and 16 seasons. Wheeler went 1-2 with a 5.11 ERA in four games in Spring Training this season.  For the Marlins, lefty Wei-Yin Chen makes his first start of the season. Chen, acquired by the Marlins last season, is 1-0 with a 1.29 ERA in one career start against the Mets. Chen is coming off his first season as a Marlin, in which he went 5-5 with a 4.96 ERA.  Tonight's game will start at 7:10 p.m., and can be seen on SNY and heard on WOR.  Are you hyped to see Zack Wheeler make his first start in over two years? What are your expectation for him tonight?
