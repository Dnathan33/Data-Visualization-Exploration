"In Greek mythology, Atlas is the titan of astronomy and navigation. He was a leader in the war between the Olympian Gods and the Titans. After the war was lost, Atlas received the harshest punishment by King Zeus: he had to hold up the heavens with bare hands and bear their weight on his shoulders forever. Atlas instructed the mankind in the art of astronomy. A lost traveler can use the statue as a compass -the North-South axis of the sphere on Atlas' shoulders points towards  the North Star as seen from New York City." ðŸ—½ðŸŒƒ #atlas #ny #newyorkcitylife #nyc #NewYork #wanderlust #travelandlife #traveldiaries #wonderful_places #travelheart #greekmythology #traceexplores
