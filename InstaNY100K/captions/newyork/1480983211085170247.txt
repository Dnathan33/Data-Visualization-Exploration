When you show up in ice stormy New York on St. Patrick's Day in your Caribbean Vacation wardrobe. Thanks to my precious bestie @laloops whom I met on the very same day 7 years ago for hooking me up with her favorite jacket (now mine) so we can go celebrate our anniversary...and yeah St. Pat too ,) Happy Antpen Day indeed!  #instagram #newyorker #newyork #acehotel #thebreslin #thejohndory #harlem #barawine #foodie#style #anniversary #stpatricksday #newyorkrestaurants #picoftheday #styleblogger #tumi  #photography #bff #beautiful #theheatlist * Salade Nicoise * Crispy potatoes compliments of @barawine_harlem
