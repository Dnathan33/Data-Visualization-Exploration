Markelle Fultz, potential #1 draft pick speaks on the possibility to play for the Knicks: “It would be amazing. It’s close to home, my family can come out. This is the greatest place to play, really. Big [arena], a lot of good fans. This is a legendary place.” “I think I can play in any system, just the way I adjust to anything. I’m very versatile. It’s cool to see that. It’s a lot of openings. That’s what I came out to see in person. Just the way they play, whatever they do on offense [I came to see]. That happens to be the triangle. I was watching the way they went through that and stuff like that.” (Follow my NBA Page! @The.NBA.Discussion)
