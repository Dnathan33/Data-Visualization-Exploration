@freshtheprophet is JEREMY, Campbell’s quasi boyfriend, is the crazy and wild “white” kid at the school. He’s a chameleon that can navigate in all types of circles whether that’s a cypha on the back streets or a rugby tournament with Carnegie and his other Ivy League friends. Jeremy has a budding rap career and is a true artist who is paving his own path. What draws Campbell, Carnegie and most other teens to Jeremy is his unwillingness to conform to the masses or what’s deemed popular; he makes others adapt to him.  #thegoldeneratv #tge
