Every morning, I try to take a moment to set an intention for the day, to call to the forefront what is needed most. Today, I'm working toward calmness. There is a whirlwind of activity in my life, for which I am infinitely grateful, but I'm working on taking a moment to breathe. #mindfulness#thankful#enjoylife#lovelyday#grateful#instagood#instadaily#yoga#breathe#intention#thankgod#bluesky#life#calm#relax#yogapractice#walking#newyork#chelsea#nyc#lookingup#happyday
