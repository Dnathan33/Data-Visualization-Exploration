| THE MET STEPS | waiting for Blair to kick me out here, but it seems like she's not around! The Steps at the Metropolitan Museum of Art are where Blair often has lunch with her minions or Serena in #GossipGirl On the steps, Blair always has to be on the top. The show makes it seem as if the Met steps are a short walking distance from the school however, the locations used for Constance and The Met Steps are not so close. In fact, I would prefer not to walk such a distance just to eat lunch. üíÅ üóΩ #OnlyInNewYork #TheMet  #NewYork #Manhattan #Brooklyn #BigApple #NYC #gay #hotdogs #usa #trip #metime #letsgo #letsgosomewhere #letsdothis #travel #wanderlust #life #livelife #photography #travelphotography #outdoor #places #go #fujifilm #fujifilm_xseries #fujifilmxt10
