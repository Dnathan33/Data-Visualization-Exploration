The New York Mets play the Philadelphia Phillies tonight as they look to win their 3rd straight game in the 2nd of of the three game set. The Mets will send Matt Harvey to the hill today. Harvey is coming of a great first start and a standing ovation in his last start. He went 6.2 innings striking out four and allowing 2 ER both coming from Matt Kemp homers. Other then that he was dominant. Harvey will be going up against Clay Buchholz. In his first start as a Philly, he had a rough day. He went 5 innings allowing 4 ER on 8 hits. When healthy he could be one of the best pitchers in the game but staying on the field has always been a problem for him.  Jose Reyes has been bumped to the 7th spot as he has started the season off at a horrible 1-27. Granderson will take his spot at leadoff tonight. First pitch is 7:10 PM ET. The game can be seen on SNY and heard on WOR 710.  #LGM #Mets #MLB #NewYork #MattHarvey #DarkKnight #Batman #Phillies #Philly #MiLB #NY #Queens #Flushing #UnfinishedBusiness
