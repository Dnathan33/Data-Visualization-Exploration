I was charmed by the adorable characters that greeted me upon entering“The Finiliar” by Ed Fornieles @arsenalcontemporarynyc. In this exhibition the artist attempts to navigate complex digital realities by linking cute companions to data sets. The characters’ emotions portray real world events, such as a joy finiliar for when the market does well and a depressed one for when it does not. Although I enjoyed these adorable characters, the information that the artist attempts to help me understand is beyond my grasp. From what I understand, the artist humanizes complex systems that are beyond most of our understanding and simplifies them by giving data sets emotions.
