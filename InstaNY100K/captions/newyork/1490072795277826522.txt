ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·This spirited, light-filled painting by celebrated Belle Ã‰poque artist, Jean BÃ©raud, illustrates Bastille Day in Paris in 1880, the first celebration of its anniversary since 1790. Exuberantly singing the Marseillaise, a group of workmen, artists, students and shopkeepers parade westward along the flag-draped rue St. Antoine from the Place de la Bastille. See it now on view in our #BondStreet galleries through 20 April, before it travels to #NewYork for our European Art auction on 24 May #SothebysEuropeanArt
