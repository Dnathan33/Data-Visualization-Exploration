Dear New York,  A year ago I said yes to you and made one of the best decisions of my life. You have shown your love for me in many glorious ways and I will always be forever thankful. Because of you I have strengthened the relationships I already had and created new ones with amazing people and places. You are my love, my soul, my heart. Thank you for all that you have allowed me to become. Cheers to many more years of celebrating our union. 🥂🗽❤🎉 Love, Risa  #newyorkcity #truelove #framily #friendsareeverything #whatyouseekisseekingyou #onedoorclosesanotheroneopens #openmind #openheart #lucky #grateful #anniversary #blessedbeyondbelief #eatallthefood #thankyou #loveletterstonewyork #donthatejason #newyork #reborn #betterthanmybirthday #maybedreamscancometrue #happinessoverload #love #cheers #toalltheyears #keepsongettingbetter #bigfish #bigpond #highfins
