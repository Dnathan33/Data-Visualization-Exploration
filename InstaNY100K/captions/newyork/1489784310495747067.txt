On Wednesday 10th April 1912 shortly after 12noon, RMS Titanic set sail from Southampton’s White Star Dock on her maiden voyage to New York. Its departure was delayed because it's sistership, the Olympic, had propeller problems and an ongoing coal strike caused a coalshortage. Here you see the three propeller set-up of the Titanic. #historytoday #history #titanic #maiden #voyage #southampton #newyork #whitestarline #propellers
