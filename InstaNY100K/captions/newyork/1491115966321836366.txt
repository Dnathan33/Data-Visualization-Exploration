Ithaca, NY (9/6/15) - I think this is starting to become a tradition: Camping/hiking on Labor day weekend somewhere in Upstate NY. Not that I'm complaining. I love these excursions. First day was spent exploring Robert H Treman State Park via the Gorge Trail followed by camping at night. Second day was spent exploring a series of waterfalls within the #Taughannock Falls State Park. The main attraction is this 215 foot drop that is eye catching even from afar. As it always seem with the waterfalls in the northeast, you have to see them early in the spring to enjoy the large gush of water. When we want to take a break from hiking, we sprint against each other as only a man and wife would. #taughannockfalls #taughannockstatepark #ithaca #ithacany #upstateny #waterfall #waterfalls #hiking #hike #outdoors #trail #newyork
