via @nbc  #NewYork will be the only #state in the #country to cover four-year #collegetuition for residents after the program was included in the #budget package approved Sunday night.  The state's #ExcelsiorScholarship program will be rolled out in tiers over the next three years, starting with full coverage of four-year #college tuition this fall for students whose #families make less than $100,000.  The #income cap will increase to $110,000 in 2018 and $125,000 in 2019. "With this budget, New York has the nation's first accessible #collegeprogram. It's a different model," said #GovernorAndrewCuomo Saturday in a statement. "Today, college is what #highschool wasâ€”it should always be an option even if you can't afford it." #sweetcandortv #positivemedia #students #hbcu #grad #education #usa #media #positive #success
