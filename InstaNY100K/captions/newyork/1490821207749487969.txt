Today turned out even better than I expected it would. ✨💆🏼😊! My professor was so kind and understanding and is willing to be so flexible with me as this semester ends. Also it's in the 80's here in the city and my walk back from class consisted of lugging this grocery bag (I still overestimate my physical strength 🤷‍♀️) but also walking in the sunshine eating my fruit and berries right out of the bag with achey arms and a happy me. My arms have declared themselves useless until further notice and my body told me I've met my sugar intake for the next two days 😂💪🏻🍉🍓🍊. Please take it from my journey that you truly should not give up. Gosh it's so easy to say that on these beautiful good days, but I mean it. Even on the hard ones I've had to be strong enough to tell myself at the very least that a happy moment like this WILL happen. I spent this last week thinking my professor was ignoring me, too busy to take time to deal with a chronically ill student, that she'd never think of staying after class longer than she ever has and talk to me and help me and collaborate with me. Turns out she never even received my emails, the university switched up her accounts and has now given her multiples, she stayed and spoke with me and came up with ideas with me. ADVOCATE FOR YOURSELF even when you feel like there's no way someone will help. Remember to keep positive and LISTEN to your gut and yourself #positivity #igotthis #keepgoing #keeppositive #staypositive #trust #lymie #lyme #lymedisease #chroniclyme #chronicillness #chronicillnesswarrior #lymewarrior #manifest #abundance #prosperity #support #happiness #sunshine #happy #nyc #newyork
