#Repost @dumbobid - "I spent four and half years at the @nyscouncilonthearts, and in the time, I really came to understand what arts and cultural orgs need, what cultural heritage needs, what artists need. But, I always felt that the key point that was missing was the business part of it–corporate was not speaking to the arts. For the ecosystem to develop, you need the business aspect to connect to the arts and culture side.” This missing link is what led Michelle Carollo to the The Made in NY Media Center. The @nymediacenter is a co-working and incubator space supporting media and tech entrepreneurs and start up companies, connecting them to business resources, education opportunities and public programming. @carollomichelle is the Community Engagement Manager, and in her two years with the Center, she has seen some amazing projects come through its doors. One of her favorites is @inkstoriesnyc. “The founder came from Rockstar Games, they do big stuff, like Grand Theft Auto. They came to the Center for a project called 1979 Revolution, which brings social impact issues into gaming. They developed an interactive game experience which takes you into an interrogation room during the Iranian Revolution. It’s really amazing. They’re upstairs now, in 20 Jay!” For Michelle, the Media Center secret sauce–what helps folks like iNK Stories develop, is the accessible staff. “You have direct access to us. And what we do best is specifically connect you to the people you need to do business." ✨{#DUMBOtrio, our weekly #instaseries, highlights the stories of #DUMBOnians in the neighborhood.
