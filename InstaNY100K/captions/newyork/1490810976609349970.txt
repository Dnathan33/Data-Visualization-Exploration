Sorting through some old photos got me missing the time I called New York City my home. ❤️ People would often tell me that they couldn't live in the Big Apple because it's too busy, crowded and noisy. 🗽But to me, it wasn't...I always managed to find peace in all the hustle and bustle and some hidden corners of the city made me feel more calm and relaxed than any other place.🙏🏼 During weekdays I would always go for a picnic to Brooklyn Bridge Park, watch the sun go down from Roosevelt Island, take a nap in Sheep Meadows, stroll through Hudson River piers...🐷 And weekends were for nature getaways. 🏕 Just a short drive upstate, in the the valley of the Hudson River, I found a paradise called Bear Mountain State Park. 🏞 I climbed up to the top and spent the entire afternoon playing with the autumn leaves. 🍁 It was a perfect clear day so all the Manhattan skyscrapers were visible even from the mountain and I remember that day being absolutely breathtaking. 🏙 I guess I just wanted to say that we always have a certain stereotype of a place (or a person?) in mind but in reality we often end up being surprised that things are actually the other way around. ☀️And one of the most courageous things anyone can do these days is to break the stereotypes.❣️ #travellingpiglet #bearmountainstatepark #newyork #plimpliinnyc #plimpliontour #newyorkcity #newyorkcitygetaway #bearmountaininn
