AJ, also known as Scooby, is still looking for his forever home! He is a 2 year old dashing gentleman with a goofy personality. AJ is up to date on shots. This is what AJ says: "I love being outside and running and can run around in circles around the yard happy as a clam and then pass out right after for some rest on the couch. I get along well with my two foster fur sisters, a grumpy 10 year-old Chihuahua mix and an energetic 2 year old Shepherd mix.  I am good with people as well, but can be a little unsure a first so it takes me a little time to warm up to you, but once I do, in the next 5 minutes or so and with treats, we are friends for life. I am a big boy and am sometimes unaware of my own strength so I might knock little kids over by accident. I am great in the house and completely potty- and chew-trained, meaning I only chew on my toys and nothing else in the house.  I walk well on the leash and have been getting better and better working with my foster parents on not pulling on the leash when I see other dogs, by using the Gentle Leader.  I learn quickly and have learned commands such as sit, lie down, catch and shake in no time!  Pretty impressive, right? I am working hard on preparing all kinds of tricks and good behavior to impress my new forever family and I know once my new family meets me they will just fall in love with me. I cannot wait to start our new life and adventure together!" Apply to adopt AJ / Scooby today: rescuedogsrocknyc.org  #rescuedogsrocknyc #AJRDRNYC #ScoobyRDRNYC #adoptdontshop #RDRNYC
