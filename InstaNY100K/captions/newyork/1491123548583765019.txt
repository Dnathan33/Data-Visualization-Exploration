Finally got my hands on @shakeshack and I might have shed some tears of joy 🤣 Everyone raves about the ShackStack burger but I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms in my burger - much preferred the SmokeShack! Also the crinkle cut fries omg I cry 😍😭🍟🍟🍟 // Have you had Shake Shack and what's your favorite burger??
