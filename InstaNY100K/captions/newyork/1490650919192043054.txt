Timeless in Times Square .  A rainy night in #CausewayBay called for a nice walk with the headphones in 🎶then I looked up and saw this.  Funny how I'm the least bit lost when I'm wandering around.  A piece of the city I loved in the city I love #NewYork #HongKong #TimesSquareHongKong #China #Instatravel #Instagay #Asia 🐷❤️🐻
