So pleased to announce that one of our most highly sought after zines, Lords of Bute Town, has finally sold out online (after many "by popular demand" restocks). They're still available at @thepalominoclub and in store at @cardiffskateboardclub so head over and grab some before you're too late â€¢ keep an eye out for Reid's next move, whatever that may be! ðŸŒ¹
