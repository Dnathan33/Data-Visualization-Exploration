#PorterTeleoWantsToKnow - Releasing an interview a week featuring our super talented clients.  The best designers in the world.  One question per day.  And this week belongs to Josh Greene! His interiors include perfectly styled vignettes, arresting architecture, and a beautiful mix of earthy colors and traditional lines. With a background in fashion, and roots in both Southern California and NYC, it is easy to see why this firm @hernandezgreene has already been named as Architectural Digest’s ‘Ones to Watch list’. @porterteleo : What do you love best about the city you live/work in?  @hernandezgreene : I can get more done in one day in New York City than in any other city. Period.
