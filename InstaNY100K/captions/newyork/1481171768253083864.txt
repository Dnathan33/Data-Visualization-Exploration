One of my favorite insta-finds thus far - @mad_brooklyn - I mean how freaking awesome is this ceramic piece!! Starts off as an aromatherapy candle and gets a second life as a bad ass succulent planter. Can't wait for her online shop to open later this year so I can get my paws on one ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ ðŸ’€ #quarterinapayphone #supporthandmade #supportthemakers #makersgonnamake #ceramics #handmade #madeinnyc #passion #patience #unique #skulls #doingitbyhand #newyork #brooklyn #madbrooklyn #succulents
