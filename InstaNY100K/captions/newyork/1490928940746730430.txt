Vischer Ferry Nature and Historic Preserve, NY -4/2017 Fallen leaf bud and sprout? On my previous visit I took a picture of what I thought was a fallen leaf bud, but I couldn't figure out what the white strands were that grew out of it. On my next visit I noticed a lot more of the 'buds' on the ground. This time, however the 'buds'' white strands were in various stages of growth. When growth and final hardening of the strands occur the growth resembles a little white tree. Glad I found them again! ðŸ˜„ #macro #macrophotography #nature #naturephotography #naturelover  #hikingphotography #hiking #hikingadventures #wanderlust #explore #adventure #natureaddict #lifeofadventure #naturegram #visualsoflife #newyork #upstatenewyork #upstateny #nofilter
