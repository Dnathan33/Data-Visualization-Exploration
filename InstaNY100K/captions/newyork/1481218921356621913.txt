I stand with @plannedparenthood everyday because every women deserves affordable healthcare. My bad ass friend @tevis_jory and I will be riding our bikes July 2nd-July 6th to support reproductive freedom, equality, and sustainability of our national forests. Click the link in my bio to support the causes we care so  deeply about that we are willing to climb 10,000 feet and sleep in tents. #istandwithpp #pinkout #babesonbikes #aclu #nationalforests #doepicshit #ridebikes #freedomride #womenscycling #feminist #dallas #newyork #bikes
