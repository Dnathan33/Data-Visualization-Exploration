Today, 105 years ago on Thursday, 11th April 1912 on 11:30 am the R.M.S. Titanic arrived at Cork Harbour on Ireland's south coast. Again, the dock facilities weren't suitable for a ship of her size, so two tenders, "Ireland" and "America" were used to transport the people. 123 passengers boarded the ship and 7 people left. Among them was Father Francis Browne, a Jesuit trainee. He took many famous photographs of the luxury liner, including the last-ever known photograph. The Titanic weighed anchor for the last time and departed on her journey across the Atlantic at 1:30 pm. PIC 1: The Titanic in all her glory at Cork Harbour. PIC 2: The view fom the Boat Deck.
