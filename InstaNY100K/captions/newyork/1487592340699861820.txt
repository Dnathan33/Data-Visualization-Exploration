🍔🍟🇺🇸🇲🇽 Guy Fieri's Kitchen & Bar (★★☆☆☆) —  The talk show host turned restaurant owner Guy Fieri has restaurants all over North America. We skipped his signature mac & cheese burger and settled for a original burger with angus beef, vegetables, an onion ring and barbecue sauce in a garlic roasted brioche bun. The burger itself was massive - too big to eat with our hands - and the flavours from the sweet barbecue sauce took over from the first bite. The soggy onion ring and large amounts of salad made it difficult to eat, and to add insult to injury the patty was served well-done - despite us ordering it medium. We liked the bun despite the lack of garlic, and the sides were excellent with a mix of perfectly deep-fried and well-seasoned crisscut, twister and shoestring fries. Unfortunately, that was the only really good thing with Guy Fieri's Kitchen & Bar. —  @guyfieri @guyfieriplaya @guyfierivegas #burger #burgers #burgerdudes #burgerlovers #burgerporn #burgertime #food #foodie #hamburger #hamburgare #instaburger #playadelcarmen #playadelcarmenburgers #lasvegas #lasvegasburgers #newyork #newyorkburgers  #🍔 #🍟 #🇲🇽 #🇺🇸
