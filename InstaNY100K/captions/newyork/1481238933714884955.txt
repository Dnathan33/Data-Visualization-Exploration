That time I stood by Yoko Ono during her son Sean Lennon's set at a tiny club in New York. I knelt in front of her to take a few shots of Sean from this angle and she looked over my shoulder as I checked out the shots on my screen. Probably the closest I'll ever be to The Beatles. #seanlennon #yokoono
