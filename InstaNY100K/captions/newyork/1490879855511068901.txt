It's officially the hottest day of the year today in NYC, and it's time for some gelato ice cream 🍦😋 My first time at Amorino on 8th Ave, which serves rose petal cones and you can get as many flavors as you want in your cone 😃Liked the pistachio, strawberry and passion fruit flavors the most . . . . . #timeoutnewyork #insiderfood #insiderdessert #nyc #newyork #newyork_ig #newyorkcity #newyork_instagram #dessert #gelato #roseicecream #foodie #instafood #foodgasm @timeoutnewyork @thisisinsiderfood @insiderdessert @nyc.gram @instagramnyc @newyork_instagram @newyork_ig @nycgo
