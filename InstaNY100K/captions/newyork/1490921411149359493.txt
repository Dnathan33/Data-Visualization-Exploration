Happy #nationalpetday to my best friend Boomer. I can't believe it's been 11 years since we first met in a military base. He's lived all over the country with me, went through 5 years in the Marines with me and greeted me with a wagging tail and a barrage of licks after 2 combat deployments! I've always had dogs growing up but Boomer and I have a connection that only happens once in a life time.üê∂ #dog #dog #puppy #pup #cute #instagood #pet #pets #photooftheday #dogsofinstagram #ilovemydog #instagramdogs #dogstagram #dogoftheday #lovedogs #adorable #doglover #instapuppy #instadog #nyc #ny #newyork #newyorkcity #uppereastside #manhattan #bestfriend #americanbulldog #pitbull
