Chapeau l'artiste ! / Hats off the performer! 🎩👌🏽 This is Marty, an incredible and fruitful #meeting during my #travel in #newyork. Before selling great hats in #soho, Marty was an #advertising art #director. He worked for most prestigious agencies as #ddb and #mccann in the early 60s. He also travelled all around the world, making good #ads here and there, from #nyc to Istanbul, not forgetting Israel and Morocco. Thank you Marty for sharing your memories, advices and for your gift. #unforgettable #legend #travelphotography #streetphotography #advertisingphotography #travelgram #travellife #ny #madmen #traveller #hat #travelpics #picoftheday #travelingram #traveltheworld #meetup #newyorker #creative #tbt #takemeback
