Happy Kindness Day! Contributions are deductible in the year made. To make it count during the tax year, gifts must be made by December 31. That doesn’t necessarily mean cash out of your account. Contributions made by text message are deductible in the year you send the text message if the contribution is charged to your telephone or wireless account. Credit card charges – even if they’re not paid off before the end of the year – are deductible so long as the charge is captured by year end. Similarly, checks which are written and mailed by the end of the year will be deductible for this year even if they aren’t cashed until 2016. #Hawaii #Idaho #Illinois #Indiana #Iowa #Kansas #Kentucky #Louisiana #Maine #Maryland #Massachusetts #Michigan #Minnesota #Mississippi #Missouri #Montana #Nebraska #Nevada #NewHampshire #NewJersey #NewMexico #NewYork #NorthCarolina #NorthDakota #donate #donation #charity
