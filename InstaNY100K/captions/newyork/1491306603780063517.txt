#Repost @scotstreetstyle Рюе­ЪљЮ­ЪЉЅ­ЪЈ╗ сЃ╗сЃ╗сЃ╗ So many life-enriching experiences from the New York City trip, but one of the real highlights was getting to share so much time and space with this big guy.  The current Mr Scotland, and one half of the world famous @kiltedyogis, Tris is a thoroughly decent human being with good values and an extraordinary connection to nature.  His energy shines very bright indeed, and he's just on the beginning of his journey - watch him fly.  Onward! Gx  RepostBy @tristancameronharper:  The other night l had the privilege of attending the @scottishballet at the @norwoodclub in NYC with my good friend Gordon @scotstreetstyle, one of the hottest arts & culture clubs in America. Very cool experience, meeting some remarkable people & luckily getting a quick portrait done ­ЪўЅ "Very ginger, beardy and Scottish looking" ­Ъўѓ РађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађРађ#newyork #newyorkcity #norwoodclub #scotsman #scotstreetstyle #scottish #beard #bearded #beardy #nyctw #gowiththeflow #laugh #happy #photography ­ЪЊИ: @stevenrosenphoto
