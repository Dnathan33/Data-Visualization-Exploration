It is easy to pretend that all is good in ones life, and really most is phenomenal. There are moments that are tough, however. These fleeting moments come when they please, linger till there is little left to ponder, and escape when most needed. On this day, as my friend and her friends sat inside this beautiful Farm to Cup Cafe in New York, I wandered the streets to let these fleeting thoughts absorb the water in my body, to penetrate my muscles, and to conquer my brain matter. What I learnt, you cannot predict such moments but you can find comfort in the chaos.
