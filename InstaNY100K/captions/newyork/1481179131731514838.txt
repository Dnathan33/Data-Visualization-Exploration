The federal estate tax is a tax on property (cash, real estate, stock, or other assets) transferred from deceased persons to their heirs.  Only the wealthiest estates pay the tax because it is levied only on the portion of an estate’s value that exceeds a specified exemption level — $5.45 million per person (effectively $10.9 million per married couple) in 2016 #Nebraska #Nevada #NewHampshire #NewJersey #NewMexico #NewYork #NorthCarolina #NorthDakota #Ohio #Oklahoma #Oregon #Pennsylvania #RhodeIsland #SouthCarolina #SouthDakota #Tennessee #Texas #Utah #Vermont #Virginia #Washington #WestVirginia #Wisconsin #Wyoming
