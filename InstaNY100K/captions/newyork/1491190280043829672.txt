Indonesia is damaged !! because the attitude of the people is very disgusting without using hearts. a lot of bad news, murder that makes one family died. "how can you imagine that ? " bastard who killed one family, mother, father, two children and grandmother. 1 kid still alive had a horrible wound on the face such as being beaten. before this happen, 1 family also died just because of robbers.  7 member of family died. and when the police catch them, they said sorry about what happen, what?  a few days ago criminal happen he stole and ran into public transport and threatened a mother and small child inside public transport, the knife almost kill her. all of this happen because economic problems. because life condition in here really difficult, all prices are very expensive but salary very little, and difficult to find job. This year I feel really terrible, about what happen. investigators corruption successful opened a case, some officials steal public money since a long time, about the electronic identity card. (investigators who uncovering this cases) he go to praying in the mosque at home, suddenly there is someone flush his face and body with alcohol (hard water). Now his face destroyed, the case still not finished. what you can say ? rottenness to others, damaging the good of others, many risks when dealing with dirty people. I hate all these problems. why the president is still walking slowly? we do not need your tenderness again, we would like you try to change all of this! nothing is fine, do not just put your eye to your business, your family, or the rich people. try to have a sense of humanity, and feel their grief.  Some people liked the meek president, but we need a president who firmly and move and think quickly to tackle crime in Indonesia. I'm very concerned! "Indonesia in danger" the death penalty for drugs but not for the murder and rape?  #indonesian  #jakarta  #indonesia  #bali  #america  #austria  #australia  #italy  #germany  #canada  #spain  #brazil  #israel  #russia  #istanbul  #spiritual  #spirituality  #asia #thirdeye  #awakening  #africa  #poland  #awakening  #newyork  #scotland  #mexico  #uruguay  #capetown
