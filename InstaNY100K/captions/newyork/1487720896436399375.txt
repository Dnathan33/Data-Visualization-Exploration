#filmfriday From August 1995. Sunrise on Cranberry Lake in New York's Adirondack Park. Shot on Fuji Velvia 50 slide film with a Nikon 8008, on one of our first trips to document the Northern Forest region of NY/NE. Back in the day, getting a box of slides back with an image like this in it was always an awesome feeling. You can plan that sunburst all you want, but when you shoot film you really have no idea if you got it, and at about $8 - $10/roll, you're only willing to fire the shutter so many times before deciding to move on to the next shot. A little different than shooting a scene like this today with the instant feedback of a digital camera. #canoe # paddling #newyork #adirondacks #cranberrylake #northernforest
