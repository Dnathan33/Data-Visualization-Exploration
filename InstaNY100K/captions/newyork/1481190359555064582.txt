Pablo Picasso once said "Colors, like features, follow the changes of the emotions." It is the core value and feelings of individuals that I try to portray and deliver the emotions from for my viewers.  From the curious gazing eyes to the posture of the body and from the changing gestures of the face to the tiny details of the skin, a human can tell endless stories to us.  Based on each of your unique personal experiences, many of you will probably relate to the portraits I share on here differently and have various take aways from them.  It is the importance of those social cues and emotions that I hold the most valuable since those shared emotions are the gateways for the moment of connection with each other.  Please tell me, in the comments section, how this gorgeous portrait of @pizzypocket makes you feel! üòå‚úåüèºÔ∏è / #discoveraround
