I'm always amazed how my piece become their own little stories.  And the journeys they go on.  To start off as inspiration from the lavender fields just outside the city of #Sault #France.  Buried in my sketchbook for years before being painted in my studio in #Rochester #NY .  It continued on to my show @whitmanworks which has been a very exciting experience.  It was purchased by a collector in #Sydney #Australia and I can't imagine the journey it will take from there.
