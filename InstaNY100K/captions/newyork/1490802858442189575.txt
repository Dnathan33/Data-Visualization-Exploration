26 miles bike ride ✔️Whoever says indoor 🚲 is a workout, has never done some outdoor cycling in the suburbs + hills.. jk 😅 .. I've been trying to switch up the way I'm training for my half marathon bc the long distance 🏃🏻‍♀️is really hard on my feet and hips; this was an awesome way to build stamina and get some extra cardio in, while working up quite a sweat and enjoying this beaaaautiful day💦💦 (This photo was taken as I was about to falll over😂) • • • All you long distance runners out there, what's the best method of cross training for you when your bod needs some rest from running? • • • #toneitupcommunity #toneitup #halfmarathontraining #running #morningmotivation #weekendvibes #instagram #instafit #workoutmotivation #workout #girl #girlswholift #tiucheckin #tiurunner #newyork #philadelphia #cycling #bikelife
