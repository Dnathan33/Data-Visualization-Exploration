Where everything, in some way, had start.  My first series "The Mecca of Coney Island" “Stand clear of the closing doors, please”. End of line, Coney Island, New York. I descend the station stairs, exiting onto Surf Avenue. Nathan's is closed, the billboard shows a record of sixty-two hotdogs eaten in ten minutes. There's a patrol car parked at the intersection. It's hot, no clouds in the sky.  #IGtakeover #cometogazebooksicily #fabrizioalbertini  #themeccaofconeyisland #NewYork #ConeyIsland #Handball
