Arriving in New York City never ceases to take my breath away. I feel so very lucky to share this trip with my family. One of my dearest friends when I was in my twenties loved to just stop and look up at the skyscrapers. He's not with us anymore, so I'll dedicate my skyscraper moments to him. #city #cityscape #friendship #newyork #newyorkcity #travel #traveler #traveling #travelphotography #instatravel #travelingram #gratitude #life #missmyfriend #nyc #manhattan
