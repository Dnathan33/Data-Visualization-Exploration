On 23 December 2003, the United Nations General Assembly adopted resolution designating 7 April, the start date of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, as the International Day of Reflection on the Genocide in Rwanda. Every year the United Nations organizes commemorative events at its Headquarters in New York and at United Nations offices around the world. Since the establishment of the Programme in 2005, commemorative activities have taken place in more than 20 countries and the victims of this tragedy will never be forgotten. If you are interested there is a video of it on UN website. The victims will always be in our hearts and will never be forgotten. We remember, We rebuild, We come out of this stronger.⠀ *******************************************************⠀ #rwanda #africa #unitednations #unitednationsheadquartes #newyork #genocide #remebrance #genociderwanda #tutsigenocide #commemoration⠀ ⠀
