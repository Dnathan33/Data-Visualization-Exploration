So excited to go take some things to my first speaking engagement in May. I am personally delivering my flyer and I am taking some personal supplies from some ladies that donated from my school to the public library for girls in need. This month, I have two seminars to teach one in South Jersey and another in Philly but May is going to kick off some fun focusing on enhancing summer plans for kids. I will be speaking on this particular day in North Philly. Bring some teenagers to hear a dynamic word! #youth #mentor #leader #mentorship #inspiration #teacher #therapist #counselor #educator #workingeducators #life #philly #philadelphia #newjersey #delaware #newyork #books #library #read #free #naorganizing #blog #blogger #bloggerstyle #entrepreneurlifestyle #entrepreneurlifestyle #boss #bosschic #teens #workshops #seminars
