You might not have seen the movie Seven Year Itch, but I can guarantee you’ve seen the scene of Marilyn Monroe standing over the subway vent having her dress blown up - "the shot seen around the world." Lexington Avenue at 52nd street here is the exact spot, though the building looks a little different and the sidewalk is wider now. Back during filming in 1954 there were multiple businesses here, including the Hotel Ambassador. That was demolished in ’66 and in ’69 345 Park Ave was opened, spanning the entire block. It’s been over sixty years but I do wonder whether the grates are the exact same or not. Probably not, right? Yeah, probably not. #lexingtonavenue #midtown #manhattan #sevenyearitch #marilynmonroe #chryslerbuilding #nypix #newyork #newyorkcity #nyc
