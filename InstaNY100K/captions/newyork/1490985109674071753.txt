How chic would your kid's room be using these colors? @aphrochic of course! Yet another collaboration between a giant creative force and our friends @colorhousepaint üôåüèΩ . . . #Repost @aphrochic with @repostapp „Éª„Éª„Éª As we get ready to close out Black History Month, we're getting ready to make a little history of our own, becoming the first African Americans to produce a collection of interior paints for home and office. Get ready for our beautiful, eco-friendly paint line in partnership with @colorhousepaint. All of our colors are inspired by Brooklyn, the place we call home. With shades like #BlackStar and #BasquiatBlue, it's an ode to Brooklyn History on every level.
