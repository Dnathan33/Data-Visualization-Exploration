I had no idea North Korea advertised on Fox News' "The O'Reilly Factor"! Haha. So I was watching CNN yesterday ("Smerconish" at around 2:20 PM Pacific) and Smerconish just finished reporting on Trump's missile attacks on Syria. He was setting up the next story on Bill O'Reilly and the sexual harassment allegations he is facing as well as the major advertisers that pulled out of his show. The graphic of the companies appear on screen and the headline "Is North Korea Next?" appears below. Huh?! What?! North Korea advertises on "The O'Reilly Factor"? Haha. Nah. They put in the wrong headline to go along with this story. The North Korea headline was for the third story, after the O'Reilly story, about Trump and possible military actions on North Korea hence the question "Is North Korea Next?" So, no, North Korea is not next to pull out of "The O'Reilly Factor". But it sure makes for a funny coincidence! #dalycity #california #bayarea #sanbruno #santaclara #sanfrancisco #newyork #newyorkcity #cnn #foxnews #fox #democrats #republican #whitehouse #gop #liberals #funny #funnypics #funnypictures #haha #oreillyfactor #smerconish
