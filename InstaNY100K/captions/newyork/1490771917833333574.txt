"Alan Cumming is getting into the nightlife game. The Good Wife actor is making excellent use of his surname to open Club Cumming, a performance-based club.  It’s opening in what’s now Eastern Bloc (505 E. 6th Street), where he’s teaming up with owners Benjamin Maisani and Darren Dryden as well as gay nightlife promoter Daniel Nardicio to convert it into his fantasy salon come September. Eastern Bloc will close in August.  Cumming’s rep tells Page Six it “will be a mixture of performance, DJs, [and] theme nights and as eclectic and unexpected as Alan himself ... Alan wants it to be a home for everyone of all ages, all genders, all sexualities, who all enjoy letting go and making some mischief. No judgments, no attitude, no rules, except kindness, acceptance and fun.”" #clubcumming #alancumming #nycnightlife #newyork #newyorkcity #nyc #nycgaynightlife #nycgay #actor #localbar #cocktails #nycbars #nightlife #drinks
