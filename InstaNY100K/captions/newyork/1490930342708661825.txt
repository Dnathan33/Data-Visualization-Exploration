So while I was home my step mom let me know there had been a bin up in the attic with stuff that was mine. She brought it down & I could feel my heart sink & my eyes almost begin to water. My aunt bought me my @gwenstefani dolls when I was younger. The part that makes it even better is that even at such a young age I decided to keep them sealed. It was like reserving my memories of my aunt from my childhood / teenage years. These are everything to me because it's not only my idol that they're made after but given to me by my favorite person, my best friend , & now my guardian angel. 🙏🏼💖 #guardianangel #gwenstefani #dolls #childhood #newyork
