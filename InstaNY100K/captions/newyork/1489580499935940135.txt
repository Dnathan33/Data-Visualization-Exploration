Our Truth is This.... B: I really don't see anything wrong with you telling your cousin how you feel. Your best friend knows he ain't shit, and he could never expect you to put him down with someone who is family to you! I say let your cousin know how you feel but also tell her that she can do with that what she wants. Sadly, I know people who would still pursue him knowing that he's a dog.  Jewelz: Explain to your cousin he is a dog and will play her. It's just that simple, yeah he is a great friend to YOU but when he is dating someone it's a completely different person. Tell you cousin you love her and you are not going to put her through that mess. Now if she tries to get at him HERSELF at least you warned her. Feel free to say I TOLD SO when he plays her.  Reign:  Exactly what B and Jewelz said.  Warn her and be honest.  If she pursues him please let her know she CANNOT, IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, complain to you about him.  No advice here bih!  #ourtruthisthis#Beyoncé#newyear#followforfollow#blackgirlmagic#warning#bestfriend#friend#newyork#miami#love#makeupartist#fashionblogger#anotherone#sunday#brunch#hook#musicvideo#no#yes#videos#spring#matcha#letsgo#redhead#april#badgalriri#boyfriend
