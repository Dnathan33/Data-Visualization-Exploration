Reporter: An article, which I believe appeared in a newspaper, asked why, since you are, or it would seem that you are, in effect, the mayor of Chicago, you've not simply been appointed to that position.  Al Capone: Well, I'll tell ya, you know, it's touching. Like a lot of things in life, we laugh because it's funny and we laugh because it's true. Now, some people will say - reformers, they'll say, 'Put that man in jail! What does he think he is doing?' Well, what I hope I'm doing, and here's where your English paper's got a point, is - I'm responding to the will of the people. People are gonna drink! You know that, I know that, we all know that, and all I do is act on that. And all this talk of bootlegging - what is bootlegging? On a boat, it's bootlegging. On Lake Shore Drive, it's hospitality. I'm a businessman!  Reporter: [to Al Capone] and what of your reputation that you control your business through violence? And those that don't purchase your product are dealt with violently?  Al Capone: I grew up in a tough neighborhood. We used to say, "You can get further with a kind word and a gun than you can with just a kind word." And in that neighborhood, it might've been true. And sometimes your reputation follows you....Yes! There is violence in Chicago. But not by me, and not by anybody who works for me, and I'll tell you why because it's bad for business.  #ambition #business #philosophy #motivation #motivational #inspirational #inspiration #1930s #family #mafia #wealth #power #hardwork #publicenemy #enlightened #money #dreams #workethic #newyork #gangster #quote #respect #chicago #honesty #realman #truth #godfather #alcapone #robertdeniro
