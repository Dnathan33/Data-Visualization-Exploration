Impressive use of concrete  #Repost @_roomonfire with @repostapp ・・・ A first look inside @herzogdemeuron's interiors for a recently completed residential skyscraper on 56 Leonard Street in Tribeca, New York. The private facilities span 17,000 square feet (1,5880 square metres) across the ninth and 10th floors of the 60-storey building. Concrete is used predominantly across the two amenities levels, which are connected via a circular staircase also made from the material. The double-height spaces are supported by thick cylindrical columns, with thin lengths of LED lighting suspended in loops from the ceilings.
