Come see these delightful bird pillows at New York Market! All the pillows were developed from original artwork of Mariah Faith Parris, an artist in Tennessee. She developed the unique backgrounds from applying sprinkles of fabric dye onto cotton paper and them spritzing it with water. The birds “came out” of the backgrounds by using colored pencils and the shapes, forms, and colors that the dye blends took. Each is unique. The artwork was photo printed on flax to preserve the individuality of the artwork. You can find them at our New York showroom today, 295 Fifth Avenue Showroom 1504.
