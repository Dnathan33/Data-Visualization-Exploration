If you want something different, you have to do things differently. It's like working out: if you want a fit body, you have to go to the gym with regularity, eat properly, drink lots of water and sleep well. There are so many steps to getting fit. The same goes for your business. You must be doing several things a day that will move your business forward. And you must be consistent to see real results. Start doing three things a day to move your business forward (three things that you know you should do, but you haven't been doing. Make a note of what they will be and what time(s) of the day  you'll work on them and then stick to it. Do that for a week and see what results you get.
