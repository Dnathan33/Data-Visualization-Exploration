@ultherapy is an effective treatment for décolletage lines 💁🏻 See what one of our patients had to say about her results on @realself 🔸Over the past few years I had been seeing lines and wrinkles form on my chest - which looked awful when wearing tshirts or low cut dresses. I did not want to wear turtlenecks for the rest of my life, so I met with a doctor to see what I could do to get rid of the wrinkles that had already formed and help stop new wrinkles from appearing. Dr. Jennifer Levine recommended I have Ultherapy on my neck and chest, and after just one treatment I saw a big difference. Dr. Levine did note that to protect the results I should always wear sunblock - so I am looking forward to a summer of sundresses, tank tops and lots of sunblock.🔸 . . . #antiaging #aging #ultherapy #wrinkles #plasticsurgeon #plasticsurgery #botox #review #beautyblog #beauty #newyork #ny #nyc #doctor #tuesday #transformationtuesday
