STYLE: Love the use of the 'Mill' Ceiling Light in this gorgeous master bedroom by Kerrie Kelly Design Lab - cleverly incorporating the 'Charlton' Wall Light as bedside lamps. Love the use of fabrics too in this space, especially that bedhead. Both lights, designed by AERIN, come in range of beautiful finishes and are available to view on our website now.
