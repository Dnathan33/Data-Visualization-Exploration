Sound Bound Fishing 🇺🇸⚓️ New Rochelle, NY Flounder Up! 🎣  Yesterday we sailed open boat with a light crowd and managed some fatties for the dinner table. Muscles and casting away from the boat seemed to have the edge over the worms! With the upcoming forecast of warm weather and sunshine fishing is getting better and better!  We are sailing everyday at 8am and have space on all trips!  We are sailing Saturday and Easter Sunday!  Easter Sunday special is 6am-2pm!! Come out and enjoy the weather and bend the rod!  Call Capt Brendan at (347)843-5310 to get in on the action!  #soundboundfishingcharters #soundboundlll #soundboundlife #fishing #fishinglife #bentrods #flounder #flounderfishing #instafishing #newrochelle #lisound #longisland #newrochelle #newyork #westchester #advertising_in_westchester #facebookfishing #spring2017 #fatties #comegetsome #calltoday #nrfuture #hudsonpark #fishon www.soundboundcharters.com
