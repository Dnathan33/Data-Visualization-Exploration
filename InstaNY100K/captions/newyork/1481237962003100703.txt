I'm going to love you. You don't have to love me back. But I'm going to love you with my whole heart. And even if you break my heart, I will always wish the best for you. I'll love you for me, not for you. Because love is a flower growing in my heart, and if my heart chooses to grow a blue flower for you, I will trust my heart. So I love you. Even if you don't love me back. #Loveisintheair #Nyc #NewYork
