@Regrann from @artistic_initiative -  Jean-Michel Basquiat (December 22, 1960 – August 12, 1988) was an American artist. Born in Brooklyn to a Haitian father and Puerto Rican mother, Basquiat first achieved notoriety as part of SAMO©, an informal graffiti duo who wrote enigmatic epigrams in the cultural hotbed of the Lower East Side of Manhattan during the late 1970s where the hip hop, post-punk, and street art movements had coalesced. By the 1980s, he was exhibiting his neo-expressionist paintings in galleries and museums internationally. The Whitney Museum of American Art held a retrospective of his art in 1992.  #modernmasters #style  #canvas  #painting  #arts #ratedmodernart #modernart #artist #artporn #gallery #artfido #contemporaryart #watching #art_helps #acrylic #instaartist #srartwork #popart #artnews #artcollective #museum #newyork #artoftheday #neoexpressionism #basquiat - #regrann
