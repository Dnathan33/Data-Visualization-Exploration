And Now You Leave Me In Defeat. Leave Me A Battered, Broken Man. "The Amount Of Love You Wish To Give Is More Than I Can Stand." Now I Have You Where I Want You. I Know That You Are Listening. This Is My Chance To, Tell You Everything. My Chance To Tell You I Love You, But I've Waited Too Long. Now The Record's Over.. Now The Record's Over #Glassjaw #GJ #Logo #MotelOfTheWhiteLocust #Losten #Lyrics #HiddenTrack #EYEWTKAS #EverythingYouEverWantedToKnowAboutSilence #LongIsland #NewYork #PostHardcore #Hardcore #Metal #Legends #DarylPalumbo #Founded #1993
