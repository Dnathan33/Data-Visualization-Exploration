Thinking of TS Elliot. A play on 'April is the cruelest month, breeding lilacs out of the dead." This is a line that has always stuck with me. Ever since college. I now understand it, maybe truly for the first time. Also inspired by a young lady I knew years ago. She was my 'thunderbolt.' #haiku #haikuaday #haikupoem #haikupoem #haikuoftheday #haikuofinstagram #haikuofnewyork #poetry #poem #poetrycommunity #poetrylover #poetrysociety #poetryofinstagram #poetryofig #newyork #newyorkcity #nyc #bigapple #writer #writersofinstagram #writersofig #words #writinglife #instahaikugram #april #aprilisthecruelestmonth
