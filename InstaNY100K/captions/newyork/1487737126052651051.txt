There is a story behind every person. There is a reason why they are the way they are. They aren't just like that because they want to be. Something in the past created them, and sometimes it's impossible to fix. You need to understand and try to change the way you think about them. Remember, sometimes you only know their name, not their story and we can't push people to tell us their story. { #dontjudgepeople }⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀#timessquare #nyc #winter #cold #coffee #taxi #crowdofpeople #newyork #middleofnowhere #me #girl #brownhair #lights #igers #tflers #grateful #happy #loveyourself #potd #ootd #tbt #instagood #fashion #beauty #friends #night #haveagoodweekend #tb
