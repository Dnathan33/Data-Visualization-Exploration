This is huge! Personally, I could not enjoy my summer because I was too worried about financial aid. Even with the reduced extremely low cost, my family struggle to pay the tuition bill on time. As a Masshole, I hate to say this but New York did something right. Congrats New Yorkers! #newyork #tuition #poorataprivateuniversity #college
