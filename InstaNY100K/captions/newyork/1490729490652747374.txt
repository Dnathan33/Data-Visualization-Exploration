Redesigned the Wisdom/Self-Knowledge corner today, in celebration of Spring! Everyday a bit more awake and grateful for the progression of this celestial play unfolding. Find your Wisdom corner by downloading a simple Feng Shui map and trying giving this area some of attention. There is a gift in this process! Curate with things that inspire and uplift your spirit. Cultivate and observe it grow. Much love to @essiejainmusic for sharing the knowledge, @flavscardoso  for the gift of this beautiful vessel &  incense & @petmurmur for the delicately bound sage to name a few of the things that come to mind as I enjoy this corner! #theworldisyourmirror #consciousness #selfknowledge #expandyourmind #growyourgratitude #fengshui #kalidevine #sakyamuni #newyork #brooklyn #letyourlightshine #dailymeditation #givemoreofwhatyouwant
