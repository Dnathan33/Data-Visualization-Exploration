One World Trade Center rising majestically above the downtown Manhattan skyline, New York. Taking a heli flight with @flynyon near sunset meant incredible golden light on all the buildings including the sun reflected in One World Trade tower. Just wow! =================== Today is my 40th birthday (in New York time). It was a dream come true to be in this amazing city the past few days and tick off so many places that have been on the bucket list for nearly 20 years. This morning I got up at 530am to go and see the sunrise in Central Park which was just magic. And even more awesome I get to spend the rest of my birthday in another country, we are off to Toronto now for 2 days to see Niagara Falls. Pretty sure I'll never beat this birthday for epicness! . . #icapture_nyc  #nycityworld #wildnewyork #newyorker #newyork_photoshoots  #ilove_newyo #nyconline #nycpulse #new_york_city_insta #newyorkstream #newyorklike #nycdotgram #city_of_newyork #instagramnyc #nycprimeshot #seeyourcity #nycgo #loves_nyc #topnewyorkphoto #ig_unitedstates #unlimitednewyork #newyork #newyorkcity #newyorknewyork #iloveny #what_i_saw_in_nyc #ig_nycity #colorofnyc #oneworldtrade
