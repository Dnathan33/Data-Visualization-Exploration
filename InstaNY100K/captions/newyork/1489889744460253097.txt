Blurred. I decided to post this because it was the only photo I was able to make of Mr.Joe. I had the pleasure of working with him at Grimaldi's Bakery where he's worked for over 25 years. He was recently diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Please keep him in your prayers.  #nikon #nikonF3 #35mm #film #filmphotography #ishootfilm #justshoot #photography #blackandwhite #notinfocus  #nyc #newyork  #peace #love #pastrychef #bakery #italianpastries #fuckyoucancer #prayforhim #gentlesoul
