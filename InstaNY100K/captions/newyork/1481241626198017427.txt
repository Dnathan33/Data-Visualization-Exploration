#Repost @sentinelsound with @repostapp ・・・ Sentinel Sound World Tour 2017  #travellinginthenameofreggae – if you follow Sentinel on any of the various social media platforms, you might be familiar with that hashtag. Ever since founded in 1998, the Everlasting Sound has been touring the world extensively. There's almost no place on the Reggae-Map where Sentinel has not been. Still, 2017 is going to be special: When you put the words "Reggae" and "travelling" together, it's pretty sure that you end up either in #Jamaica, the motherland of our beloved music, #NewYork or #London. This year, the German Luger Sound will play shows in all three capitols of the international Reggae culture within three weeks in April. From hardcore dubplate showcases alongside the world's top clash sounds like #BassOdyssey, #KingAddies and #SoulSupreme to parties with juggling monsters like Massive B and Stone Love – this tour features everything. And that was only the first leg of the tour - the second one follows shortly after, when Daniel and Allgi fly out to Japan for two weeks, in May. For the first time in seven years, Sentinel will play in the Far East. Countless great things have been said about the Dancehall scene in #Japan but one thing is for sure: The Japanese people are addicted to Jamaican music. And Sentinel is more than willing to give them their drug of choice.  From the West to the East, from Jamaica to Japan, in less than 2 months – #travellinginthenameofreggae #sentinelsound #reggae #dancehall #dubplates
