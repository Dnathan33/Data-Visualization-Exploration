Is it Friday yet?!? Anyone else feel like this week is dragging quiiiiiite a bit? ☂️💤• A little Wednesday wake up call this morning with some #tiudailymoves (abs +booty) and I will finish up the cardio tonight with a long run in Central Park.. no days off 👍🏻Once we're over the hump today, I can pretty much see the weekend, let's get moving 👀 **Also, just realized 1 month till my first half marathon 😬 • • #toneitupcommunity #tiunyc #centralpark #wednesdaze #wednesday #workoutmotivation #workout #fitspo #fitness #running #halfmarathontraining #tiuteam #inspired #workhard #nyc #newyork #tiugirl
