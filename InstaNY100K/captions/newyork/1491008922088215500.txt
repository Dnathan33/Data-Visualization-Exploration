Another day, another mansion 🏛. This beautiful mansion is located at Old Westbury Gardens estate 🏞🌾. It was built was John Shaffer Phipps in 1906 (construction 🏗 started in 1903). The whole estate covers around 160 acres! Great place to walk around, learn some history and relax.  #instatravel #mansion #gildedage #palace #garden #park #newyork #picoftheday #adventure #instamood #traveller #travelling #relax #wanderlust #explore #beautiful #breathtaking #instamoment #bestoftheday #love #greatview #amazing #travel #traveling #traveler #inspiration #photooftheday #instagood #travelgram
