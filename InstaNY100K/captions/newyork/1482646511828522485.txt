The Brooklyn Bridge! I was able to capture it from a boat this last week on a work trip to new New York! Not going to lie, I despise big cities but she was sure a beaut at night from the water!  Shot handheld at f4 with my older d90, it doesn't handle low light that well but I lucked out! #newyork #brooklyn #spiritcruise #sunset #brooklynbridge #citylights #roadtrip #wideangle #ipulledoverforthis #allbeauty_addiction #nikon #nikontop #shotoftheday #sigma
