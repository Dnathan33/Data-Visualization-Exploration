Friday saw a dramatic day in the #preciousmetals #market. In the aftermath of the US retaliatory strike on Syria, #gold and #silver both rose sharply higher in the overnight hours early Friday morning, only to reverse lower by the close of #trading for the week.  In general, short-term #political and/or terrorism-related market reactions tends to be short-lived. Friday proved to be no exception. Let us turn to an examination of the silver market, which saw the most dramatic move on Friday. For the week as a whole, silver underperformed gold, finishing lower by $0.30 cents or 1.7%. The final #trade on the #NewYork electronic access market was $17.96.  #bullionexchanges #bullionaire #bullion
