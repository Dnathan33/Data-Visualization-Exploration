My #mcm this week is #halfischer (sorry for bad angle but tried to get least reflection as possible) whose work I saw at the @independent_hq presented but first discovered during research for my thesis in the amazing book "Art & Queer Culture" by Catherine Lord and Richard Meyer. This work "Street Fashion Basic Guy" 1977 depicts a gay man and the fashion he is wearing. Fisher. A San Francisco based photographer, created what he called "Gay Semiotics", a type of photograph with text described the humorous and visual codes of clone culture. "Combining his interest in structuralist theories of communication (semiotics) with the vibrant gay scene in San Francisco, Fischer diagrammed the 'signifiers', 'fetishes', 'arcgetypucal media images' and 'street fashions' popular among homosexuals at the time."-Richard Meyer "Art &a Queer Culture" page 27. ðŸ–¤  #artandqueerculture #gay #semiotics #gaysemiotics #sanfrancisco #1970s #richardmeyer #catherinelord #queer #queerart #queerculture #independent #independenthq #independentartfair #artfair #artfairweek #newyorkcity #newyork #newyorkart
