There's something so soothing about laying under a tree on a warm Spring day, looking up at its branches as they sway in the wind, hearing the gentle rustling while the light of the sun haphazardly glimmers through its leaves. And, it's made all the better when laying next to the love of your life. üòç Ahhh...Spring. üíö . . . #BowdoinPark #WappingersFalls #WappingersFallsNY #HudsonValley #HudsonValleyNY #HudsonValleyNewYork #IG_HudsonValley #DutchessCounty #Beacon #BeaconNY #Spring #SpringDay #BeautifulDay #Trees #Treegram #NY #NewYork #NewYorkState #DownstateNY #ILoveNY #ILoveNewYork #HVCompass #VisitVortex #Nature #Naturegram #IG_Serenity #Romance #Peace #NYCToBeacon #BeaconTransplant
