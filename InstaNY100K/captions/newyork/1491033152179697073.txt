April 12 Titanic's voyage is proceeding as expected. Crew and passengers are still acquainting themselves with the ship. Ice warnings from ships making transatlantic crossings are received. At 11 pm the ships wireless stops working.  This painting shows Titanic passing her sister Olympic in the English Channel. It's unlikely the ships ever passed this close, probably just on the horizon to each other.  #Titanic #titanic105 #ships #shiphistory #maritimehistory  #UK #Ireland #France #Southampton #Belfast #newyork #Cherbourg #whitestar #whitestarline
