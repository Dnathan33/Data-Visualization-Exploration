S U N D A Y S 😍 Yup! We are still all together, craving coffee, fighting over pastries and loving each moment of it! We switched the Hamptons for Williamsburg 😳 and it was so much fun! Ventured to the carrousel in Dumbo and strolls at Brooklyn Bridge... crazy times with the craziest most lovable characters I know and I am loving every minute of it as so is my beautiful kid! #thankyou #sunday #brunch #family #love #moments #life #happy #today #nyc #newyork #sweets #baking #lucky #mom #momlife #yay #vscocam #photooftheday
