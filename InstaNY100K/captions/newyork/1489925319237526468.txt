One of my all time favorite, my very first landing in the land of uncle Sam. Experiencing first hand what all the fuss is about. At that time I was struck by the bigness of the city and the buzzing. But Im sure now more than ever that some hives (Im looking at you Manila) are even more scarier ðŸ˜€  #travels #travelstyle #awesomelife #memories #newyork #usa
