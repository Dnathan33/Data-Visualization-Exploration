Completed the 9/11 museum project last night now starting an insulation job this morning. Putting plastic down, start drilling the walls and filling with cellulose insulation. Usually takes a day and we are done and you'll never know we were there. #cellulose #insulation #brooklyn #drillandfill #newyork #home
