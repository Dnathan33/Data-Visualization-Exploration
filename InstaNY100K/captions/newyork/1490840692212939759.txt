"Sometimes healing does not come immediately, or at all, because of our need for growth. All experience is for our good, and sometimes it takes what we would consider a negative experience to help develop our spirits" âœ¨ðŸ’—âœ¨ðŸ’—âœ¨ . I wasn't sure if this book would be my thing but I found it very touching, inspiring & comforting in terms of personal struggles and the loss of a loved one, I really recommend it! . . . #embracedbythelight #bettyjeadie #bookclub #lossofalovedone #grief #griefsupport #love #heaven #light #unconditionallove #newyork #timesbestseller #london #eveningreads #potd #fitfam #inspiring #comforting #spirituality
