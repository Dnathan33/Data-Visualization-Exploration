#ladyliberty #light of the #world The #statueofliberty #silhouette against the #sun on #libertyisland in #newyork #harbour The #island was chosen not only because the #statuewould be seen by all passing #ships heading into #nyc but also because it contained a #military #fort which made the #perfect #foundation for the #pedestal The #foundations are so #strong that they say the #island would have to turn #upsidedown for the #monument to topple!
