Rise and Shine kiddies! The early bird catches the worm. Be Made Whole is up early preparing for our exciting double header in NYC this weekend! By the way, we love 😍 our new #labeling for our #deodorants. Do you? 😝  If you would like to place an order, please do so before 2pm! We will deliver to the 5 boroughs and surrounding areas.  Join us tomorrow at the Jamaica SDA Church tomorrow for our Natural Health Pop Up Shop at 7pm located at 8828 163rd St in Jamaica, Queens. If not, catch us on Sunday from 11am-5pm where we are excited to, once again, be an exhibitor at the 10th Annual Veggie Pride Parade located at 14th St Union Square! Catch us while you can!  #bemadewhole 🌿🌱🙌🙏 #willYOUbemadewhole #john5v6  #queens #NY #newyork #14thstunionsquare #popupshop #veggieprideparade #NaturalHealth #ShopAdventist #Healthmessage #rightarmofgospel #SDA #vegan #plantbased #organic
