On the road again ✈️ can't wait to run where I'm going🌴☀️just have to cure this damn man cold first. Travel pro list: 1️⃣only carry on, no checked luggage (it's a challenge, but you can do it) 2️⃣Run before going to the airport (will make you calm) 3️⃣Earplugs (what I use every night so I can easily fall asleep everywhere) #travel #traveltips #traveltheworld #newyork
