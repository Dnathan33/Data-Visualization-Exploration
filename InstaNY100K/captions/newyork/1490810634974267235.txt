#The #world does not #see the destruction and pollution of the environment, especially the #sea and the sea #system. The #whales are the #biggest evidence of pollution of the marine environment. Whales were killed by fishing wires, seafarers' violations #and #human contaminants. #It #is #really #sad and unfortunate. #globalwarming #nasa #health #america #usa #newyork #Hollywood #losangeles #california #picture #pic
