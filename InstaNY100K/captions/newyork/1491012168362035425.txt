"I came to New York to make a difference. I was so young and full of ideas. It's been nineteen hour days for as long as I can remember.  I had a big pitch today. I thought it went well, but nobody seemed to bite. If this doesn't take off I'll have to leave New York" (New York, USA) . . . . . . #wvu #nmun #unitednations #Cuba #mun #newyork #speech #humansofnewyork
