Went all the way to Williamsburg, neglected making reservation at Peter Luger 😒 But we found this gem instead! Listed as one of the best steak places in NYC, it didn't disappoint! Loving the understated cool vibe Brooklyn exudes ❤  #stanselm #newyork #brooklyn #steak #sogoodandidontnormallyeatsteak #williamsburg
