. - A  N e w  Y o r k  M o m e n t - . It's hard to believe that this time last year I was living in New York City, as it already feels like a lifetime ago. I often reflect on past experiences to be able to learn from both the positive and the negative and how to constantly try to adapt, have internal personal growth and to strive to be better. Change is hard. It is also the only thing in life that is guarantied to happen. Sometimes things don't always work out the way you planned them to, but it is the way you choose to process, adjust and embrace it that impacts your life. The choice is always yours and I hope you are all able to start this week with a new perspective.ðŸŒ¸ . . . . . . . . . . . . . . #newyork #newyorkcity #newyorkpubliclibrary #nypl #capetown #southafrica #reflection #Å¥houghtoftheday #monday #fashion #style #womensfashion #girl #design #create #creative #perspective
