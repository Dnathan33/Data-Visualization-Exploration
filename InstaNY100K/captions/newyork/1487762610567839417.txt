Tonight the love of my life, my best friend, my soul mate, my everything proposed to me and of course I said yes! I couldn't be happier. He surprised me at sunset looking over Adelaide at one of our first date spots and then again by taking me to dinner at our first dinner date spot where our families were waiting to congratulate us. Then to finish it off a night at the intercontinental 😍😍😍 he is the man. This is so surreal #engagement #boyfriend #fiance #sunset #dinner #family #surprise #ring #marriage #married #couple #selfie #happiness #perfect #adelaide #losangeles #newyork #sydney #brisbane
