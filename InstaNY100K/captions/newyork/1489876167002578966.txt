It's finally warming up over here. So I got my camera with me everyday.  But when I don't have it, it is writing ideas and planning shoots. This spring/summer is going to be dope. Plus going to be using a lot of reflectors and natural light this summer  What creative tactic do you guys have planned or want to tackle this year?
