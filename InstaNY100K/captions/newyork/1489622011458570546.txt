Just wanted to give everyone that had helped me with my New York adventures a shoutout! Thanks @marier9124 @suave_bossla @jessc.__ for hosting me! Thank you @dchai75 for taking me around town and attending the award ceremony with me and thank you @nyciff for inviting and nominating us for these two amazing award! Thank you to everyone else that participated in this process.  Last bit far from least, thank you @laura_ashleysarcasm for submitting the film in the first place and starting this whole adventure. You believed in it enough to go out of your way for it and it really paid off!  You all  have to pursue your dreams because your dreams will not be the ones to pursue you! ✌🏼
