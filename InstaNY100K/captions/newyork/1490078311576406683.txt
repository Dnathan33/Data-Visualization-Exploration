'Hamburg' by New York-based artist Dennis DeGraw, from his Lifeboat series, 2013 --> DeGraw is a captivating artist who incorporates personal writings alongside his paintings, introducing viewers to his visual work through a personal expression of words and stories, keeping a visual and written diary of his life and ideas. "Hamburg was painted in the basement of my Aunt's house during Fall 2013. This location holds a special place in my heart as it is a property that has been owned by the DeGraw family since 1948. It is the place where my mother, her brothers and her sisters spent their childhoods, a place with tangible energy. I think its energy flowed out into visibility in this piece." @dennis_degraw  www.dennisdegraw.com #art #arte #artist #dennisdegraw #newyork #nyc #miami #visualarts #abstractexpressionism #paintings #writings #contemporaryartist #i #me #igcurator #miamiartscene #artlovers #artcollectors #instapic #instamood #instagramhub #picoftheday #artsy #igdaily #instadaily #artoftheday #instapic #instaart #instagallery
