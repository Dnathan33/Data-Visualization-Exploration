"Practice" is what they say to get to Carnegie Hall. Walking into the artist entrance felt like a Meccan pilgrimage, remembering those who have stepped through those same doors. The first artist that comes to mind was on May 9, 1965- after a 12 year absence from the public stage, he gave a solo recital that is now an instant classic. I remember watching the documentary The Last Romantic by Albert and Davis Maysles starring Vladimir Horowitz, and I fell hard for the metropolitan concert pianist's charism, virtuosity, and the piano that he took with him around the world. As I waited to perform on that same stage, I played on a glossy Steinway B piano (serial number 110, which is a specially made piano) on the sixth floor to calm the nerves in the warmup room. I couldn't help but play Beethoven, Chopin, Scriabin, and the most recent La La Land soundtrack for the choristers. As we got ready, there was a silence and led them in some vocalise. As we processed down to the threshold of the stage I was reminded of the time Horowitz himself hesitated and his wife Wanda helpfully nudged him onto the stage. "Wow" was all I could think as I walked into the limelight. #allthefeels #johnrutter #horowitz #upperleftusa #pnw #upperrightusa #newyork #newengland #beethoven #scriabin #chopin #lalaland @carnegiehall @steinwayandsons @steinwayandsonssea
