When it comes to finding a hidden spot as a photographer is like winning the lottery! When the first location was deemed unfit as a photographer we turn our eyes into a scope and envision something much greater then what we might see and this photo shows you that a overgrown park where the sun shined perfectly through it is an amazing location! Thank you Cassie and Joe for giving me the opportunity to photograph your engagement! I can't wait for the wedding :)
