🌸 Let’s begin our trip from the city of Kazan. We took a train 🚂 to Moscow on May 31st. I was there in 12 hours by the next day. Our flight ✈️ was scheduled on June 2nd at 5:60 am so I went to my relatives (thank you for being hospitable) ❤ I don’t know how but I felt stiff that day 🤕 but thank God, eventually, everything got better. At 5:30 Moscow time, Alina and I were on our way for the great adventures. We had a layover in Rome, Italy 🇮🇹 so I had the opportunity to look at the city from high height and to enjoy the Italian language. I was so excited that I just couldn’t fall asleep on the way to New York from Rome. I spent my time 🤔 eating 🥘 and watching Zootopia 🦊🐰 (good thing it was in English not Italian). When it comes to Alina, she spent all 10 hours sleeping 💤 Finally, we got to our destination point. New York City 🗽 There was a huge crowd 👨‍👩‍👧‍👧 for the passport control and you could see different people from different countries. I was a little bit scared 😳 that these strict men in cabins 👨🏻‍✈️can send me back home, but it all was silly thoughts in my silly head 💁🏻 And here is the moment I will never forget when I got out of the building of JFK International Airport and inhaled the American air! 🇺🇸 ✔️ to be continued 🔜
