"The Swans of Fifth Avenue" by Melanie Benjamin tells the story of the glamorous world of NY high society in the 1950s. It follows the relationship between Babe Paley, a Vogue cover beauty, and Truman Capote. - - It mixes in the lives of other well-known and up and coming NY socialites. Capote's literary success after "In Cold Blood" culminates in the party of the century: The Black and White Ball. It was an event so grand that people begged to be invited. But what comes after is a shocking betrayal of friendship. - -  The Anna Wintour Costume Center at The Metropolitan Museum of Art (on Fifth Avenue) houses a permanent collection of fashion pieces. It also has special exhibitions--like the incredibly successful Manus x Machina where this was taken. -  I imagine that Babe Paley would have worn an outfit like this if the Black and White Ball were held today. - - - #theswansoffifthavenue #melaniebenjamin #capote #themet #costumeinstitute #fifthavenue #manusxmachina #eat #read #travel #eatreadtravel
