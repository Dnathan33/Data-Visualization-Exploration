We did Ellis and Statue Islands yesterday... including the "Hard Hat Tour" of the old hospital and immigration centre on Ellis Island. It was really interesting to learn a little of America's immigration history and to do something that was maybe a little bit different with the day! . . . . #goingonanadventure #theadventurecontinues  #usa2k17 #timeofmylife #simplythebest #bff #bffl #usa #liberty #statueofliberty #ellisisland  #libertyisland #abandonedplaces #hardhattour #knowledgeisaweapon #beautifulday #nyc #NewYork #NewYorkCity #ladyliberty #roadtrip #roadtripping
