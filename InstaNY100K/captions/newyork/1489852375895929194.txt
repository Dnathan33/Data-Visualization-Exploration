Good morning my old friend. It's been way too long. Today's run was less about pace and more about enjoying the views and spending time with thoughts and my gorgeous City washed in morning light. Thank you New York for always making getting up early worth my while. #lovethisCity #runthisCity #morningviews #NewYork #BKBridge #shadowsandlight #runner
