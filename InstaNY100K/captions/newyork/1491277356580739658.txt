Sat on the rooftop after a run through the neighbourhood yesterday evening. There were people out on the front stoops of their brownstones; music playing, food cooking - summer is really on its way! I almost forgot what it felt like to walk around in a t shirt hahah. [NY spring already feels like NZ summer, so I'm actually a little apprehensive of the stickiness of the summer heat and #subwaylyf] #newyork
