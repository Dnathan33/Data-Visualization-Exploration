Reposting this because NY hip-hop stations always play the most degrading songs and always ignore any positive uplifting songs. It's like they are trying to poison the minds of our youth. We talk about how we need to uplift our selves as people of color, yet we entertain all this music about doing drugs, selling drugs, and killing each other. All that is doing is putting us in jail and putting money in the pockets of the private prison system.  @joeybadass just dropped one of the best hip-hop albums of the year, with so many positive messages for people of color, but not a single spin on @hot97 or @power1051, his hometown hip-hop radio stations???? Can't keep supporting this foolishness. #BoycottHot97 #Boycottpower105.1 . . . . .  #knowledgeispower #supportgoodmusic #boycott #repost #wakeup #staywoke #takebackpower #brainfood #education #rebel #hiphop #newyork #nyc #blackpower #supportrealhiphop #hot97 #power105 #weneedchange #changeisgood #protest
