Working on the elephant at the time I was so unsure of feedback from others... this was probably a day or two before my solo show.. @dbwlgusdl was always there no matter what.. to help and support but most importantly believe in me ..thank you 😘🙏🏽 Ps. I lost Mr. Morado top hat on my way back to the states  #moradoworld #yearofthecircus #australia #elephant #sculpture #art #la #newyork #mascot #purple #sydney
