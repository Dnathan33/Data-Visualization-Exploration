Have you worked with Thermory Wood Decking  and their joint-end-match system? Not only is this decking board milled from American Ash and thermal-heated to re-arrange the cell structure to reduce movement related to moisture, but this joint can be installed without resting on a joist, offering an even higher yield and faster install time than decking alternatives. â€¢  Manufacturer representatives will be at our yards all week so make sure to stop by! DM us for specific locations and times.
