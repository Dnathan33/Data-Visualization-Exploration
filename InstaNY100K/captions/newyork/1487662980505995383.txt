Sunrise! ðŸŒ„ðŸŒž I woke up to this! Sooo beautiful. This is more breathtaking than it looks.  This Sunrise ðŸŒ… is not for the week or month. It's for TODAY! It reminds me of the opportunities we get daily. Which we miss most of the time. Also reminds me that as Soul, I can only live in the present -This moment! Taking one day at a time. Breathing freely, thinking freely, being happy, loving and seizing every opportunity that comes my way.  Have a wonderful Friday.  #sun #newyork #soul #life #instagood #instapic #newjersey #jerseycity #grateful #nature #outsidemywindow
