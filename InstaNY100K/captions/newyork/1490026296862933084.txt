"Natalie de Blois, starting in 1954 and while at SOM, was one of the leading architects on Lever House, as well as the Pepsi-Cola and Union Carbide buildings, all on Manhattan’s Park Avenue. She worked closely with the partner Gordon Bunshaft, who is accredited officially for the designs. The true apportioning of her contribution and his are unknown” — Annie Coggan, “Looking for Natalie” (APS 23) .
