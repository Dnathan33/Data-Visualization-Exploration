When shit gets challenging I try to remember the Trichotomy of Control. It keeps your focus aligned on the things you have control over instead of the things you don't. High level, there are 3 buckets. Things you have control over, things you have no control over, and things you have some control over. The idea is to spend your efforts and worries proportionately to the things you can control. Seems like common sense, but in practice it's easier said than done. For anyone who's interested, I highly recommend reading "A Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy"
