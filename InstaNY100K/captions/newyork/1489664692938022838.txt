| birthday trip | Happy birthday to my best friend and twin. I'm very happy that we finally are in New York for our birthday, which I know we had planned many years ago. You definitely are a strong person inside and out showing me what it looks like to push through the hard times & still come out better. Thank you for your continual support & love. #memories #newyork #birthdayfun #twinsisters #QnAtakeNewYork
