#Repost @p21_gallery with @repostapp ・・・ Ai Weiwei to build over 100 fences and installations around New York City this autumn in his latest work - 'Good Fences make Good Neighbors' commissioned by the Public Art Fund. Ai Weiwei is quoted as saying 'When the Berlin Wall fell, there were 11 countries with border fences and walls...by 2016, that number had increased to 70. We are witnessing a rise in nationalism, an increase in the closure of borders, and an exclusionary attitude towards migrants and refugees, the victims of war and the casualties of globalization.' 🗽🌍 . .
