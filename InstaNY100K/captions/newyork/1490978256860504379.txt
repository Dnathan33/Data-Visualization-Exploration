There's a sort of clarity, an exhale of breath you didn't know you were holding in when you realize that someone truly understands what you've been going through, how you've been feeling, and how defeated your state of mind is, simply because they've been through it all and can empathize. Sometimes, something as small as that can mean the world. Conversation and musing make a vista like this all the more special. I'm so thankful for the mentors I have in life; even luckier to call them friends. ðŸ’•
