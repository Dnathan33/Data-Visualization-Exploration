"A collection of feathers bound together in you head" BQP 2017 80x80cm ⠀ ---------⠀ If you want money in your pocket⠀ And a top hat on your head⠀ A hot meal on your table⠀ And a blanket on your bed⠀ Well today is grey skies⠀ Tomorrow is tears⠀ You'll have to wait til yesterday is here⠀ Well, I'm going to New York City⠀ And I'm leaving on a train⠀ And if you want to stay behind⠀ And wait til I come back again⠀ Today's grey skies⠀ Tomorrow is tears⠀ You'll have to wait til yesterday's here⠀ If you want to go⠀ Where rainbows end⠀ You'll have to say goodbye⠀ All our dreams come true, baby up ahead⠀ And it's out where your memories lie⠀ Well, the road is out before me⠀ And the moon is shining bright⠀ What I want you to remember as I disappear tonight⠀ Well, today's grey skies⠀ Tomorrow's tears⠀ You'll have to wait til yesterday is here⠀ Well, today's grey skies⠀ Tomorrow's tears⠀ You'll have to wait til yesterday's here⠀ You'll have to wait til yesterday's here⠀ You'll have to wait til yesterday's here⠀ ------⠀ #brockqpiper #abstractart  #modernaustralianabstraction #art #collectable #birds #melbourneartist #tokyo #newyork #california #london #paris #berlin #sydney #instagretable
