As we launch into this week, the sky tells us stories- it is a tapestry, a thoroughfare, a holder of dreams, a repository of fears, a shield, a sword of Damocles- how we see it, however, is not a reflection of what is truly there, but rather a reflection of who we are. Let us know in our hearts that we are powerful, that we can achieve the impossible, that we can channel reality to manifest that which we most value and desire, and the world looks much brighter, the clouds smile upon us, the shapes in the sky are less forbidding and more omens of good times ahead. But if we let the "NOs" of our lives rule our interpretation, demons and dragons, rain clouds and storms, beset us on all sides, planes seem to fall from the sky and the sun appears a black hole. Let us thus approach the coming challenges with unbounded and unbridled optimism and gratitude, that we might see for every door that closes two more that open - fortune favors the bold, and ingenuity will win the day.  ________________________________________ ________________________________________ . . . . . . . . #Positivity #MondayMotivation #Growth #Stoics #DontBelieveEverythingYouThink #Clouds #Plane #Airplane #Flyboys #Miami #miamibeach #NewYork #Ibiza #London #Sony #SonyAlpha #a7 #A7Rii #PhotoOfTheDay #AlwaysBeLearning #AlwaysBeGrateful #AlwaysBeBuilding
