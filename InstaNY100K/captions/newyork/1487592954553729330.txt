A 1902 project: I mean... dammit... New York's iconic Flatiron Building still leaves me in dreamland. I was shopping close by so I had to look it up. Tall for its time, its height was made possible by a change to NYC's building codes in 1892, which eliminated the requirement that masonry be used for fireproofing "considerations" (I love that word). This made way for steel-skeleton construction so it went up in a year... er... a New York minute!... something like that.
