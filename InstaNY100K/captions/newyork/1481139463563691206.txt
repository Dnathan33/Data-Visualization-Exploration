#Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe, born in #1886 in #Aachen, joined Peter Behrens' #architectural #office at the age of 22; there he met #Walter_Gropius and Le Corbusier. Soon, Mies van der Rohe became a #protagonist of the new #glass and #steel #architecture of the time. His #design for a glass and steel #high-rise #building at #Bahnhof Friedrichstrasse in #Berlin was decisive. He was responsible for the #artistic direction of Deutscher Werkbund starting in 1925. In 1927, the #Weissenhofsiedlung in Stuttgart was created under his direction. In 1930, Walter Gropius appointed Mies van der Rohe to the position of director of the #Bauhaus; on August 10, 1933 he had to close it under pressure from the NSDAP. He afterwards emigrated to the United States. In 1938 he went to #Chicago, where he took over the direction of the architecture department at the #Armour_Institute. He became one of the most influential architects in the #world. His steel skeleton buildings with large-scale glass curtain walls such as the Seagram Building in #NewYork (1958) or the National Gallery in Berlin (1968) are among the highlights of modern architecture. His #furniture designs usually evolved in connection with his buildings. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe died in 1969 in Chicago. #jeddah #Riyadh
