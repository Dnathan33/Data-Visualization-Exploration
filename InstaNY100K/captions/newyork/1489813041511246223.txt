Good morning! Jesus was born just to die for the sins of the world. For this, I'm eternally grateful.  Many times those in the office of ministry, think someone should be serving them when it's the other way around. All Christians from the babes in Christ to the highest elder, should still be servants to carry out the purpose of the Lord. I never want to be caught up in the world's way of doing things. People will set you up to fall, if you let them. We must insist that we be workers and doers in the vineyard. Have a merry day!#god #jesus #bible #homeless #christianity #christians #pray #lord #christ #salvation #praise #worship #motivationalquotes #saved #jesuschrist #london #newyork #holyspirit #jehova #bless #memes #sunday #somebody #churchmemes #memehistory #life #love #my #yes #blessedüôè
