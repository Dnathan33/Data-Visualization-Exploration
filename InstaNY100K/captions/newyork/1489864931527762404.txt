Saturday, April 22nd, 5pm â€“ 9pm Stop by @microsoftstore on 5th Ave.  where I'll be exhibiting all of my work and even creating a piece live using Microsoft technology. There will also be stations for attendees to digitally create their own art pieces! It's going to be a great experience. Can't wait to see you! #Microsoft #jamesthigpenjr #NewYork #5thAve #NYC #Art #GraphicDesign #BrooklynArtist #Flint #VR #music ðŸ“·: @cam.st.claire
