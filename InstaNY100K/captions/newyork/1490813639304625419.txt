i definitely enjoy the change in scenery. but sometimes i miss the overwhelming streets of people, waiting for the subway in the frigid winter or sweltering summer, how you could go from one borough to another with just one swipe of the metro, and $1 pizza at 2am. it wasn't the 5 star restaurants or the 4am night clubs that i loved. it was the attitude of the city.  we'll just have to see what life brings. ~~~ #coneyisland #brooklyn #newyork
