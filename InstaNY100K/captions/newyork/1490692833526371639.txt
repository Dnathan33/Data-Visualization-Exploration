Brooklyn's freedom pic!! ...and, errr, Coco!  Yep, I drove down to the shelter to pick up Brooklyn and, as I was waiting, little Coco came in as an owner surrender. Ears down, tail between her legs and an absolutely shocked look on her face as if to say, "where the hell am I?" She's around two years old and clearly recently had babies. She was breaking my heart. So I said to myself, I came down here to save Brooklyn.. I might as well save Coco too." So into the car all three of us went!  They're both sweet as can be and will be available for adoption after they're medically cleared. Welcome to the Pack!  #LookingGlassAnimalRescue #LGAR #GoRescueNation #CocoLGAR #BrooklynLGAR
