L❤ve is your story #1  I heard this story a while ago, a "from human 2 human" moment that really touched me. In this new segment "Love is your story" I do not post my own collected stories but the stories I come across online that have truly touched me.  Yvonne lives in New York and during her first pregnancy no men ever offered his seat to her on the subway. So during her second pregnancy she had an award made for the first guy that would offer his seat to her. I wish I could have seen Rick's face the moment he got the award! (Check @helloyvonnelin to read her personal post)  Yvonne & Rick, I Love both of your hearts. That's what it is all about "How can I give, help, be of service". Sadly enough it seems like the world is turning more and more into a "How can I GET MORE of what I WANT" society. "Me, me, me,me, me" It is all about "Me". One time I was on the subway and there was this lady crying. It was so crowded but nobody noticed her tears. I reached out to her and even though I couldn't do anything, she felt supported by my gesture. I am not saying this to point out that I was the person who reached out. I could have easily been focusing on my phone or be sucked away in my own thoughts at that moment. But I am so glad that I wasn't.  All I am saying is dear people, let us open up our eyes so we can really SEE the world around us and interact from our heart. Any small gesture is of great value!  Thank you @helloyvonnelin for celebrating this moment in such a hartwarming & special way! And thank you @rickybarksdale for just being you and doing something that seems so natural but unfortunately is becoming so rare.
