We💚Sustainable Daisy! #Repost ・・・ ECO♻️OOTD! feat. this recycled bag from @remembermegreen! The bag is made from repurposed New York billboards... Seriously! 😍💥 After their ad time has expired, billboards around New York City are taken to the Remember Me Green factory where they are cut, cleaned, steam-pressed and sewn together into designs. Because of this, each bag is incredibly unique. This concept allows you to take a piece of New York with you and incorporate that creative energy into your outfit! RMG explains, “Our team recognizes the creative energy that goes into these billboards and give them a new life once they are taken down." I love how an advertisement can have a life and purpose, then be torn down and transformed into a beautiful bag! The story behind every tote is so beautiful and purposeful by diverting landfill waste and making use of existing materials. Check the @sustainabledaisy blog or our Facebook for the full story!
