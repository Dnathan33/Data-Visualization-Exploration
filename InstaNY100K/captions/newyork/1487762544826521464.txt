Kapwani Kiwanga Flowers for Africa (South Sudan) for LEARNING FROM BIG MISTAKES on 53 Orchard Street until April 9:⠀ Her series Flowers for Africa (2012-present) consists of flower arrangements that appear in photographs of the celebrations of independence of African states. The floral arrangement on display (Flowers for Africa, South Sudan, 2017) originates from a press photo documenting the first day of the independence of South Sudan on July 9, 2011. The bouquet was given to a political delegation in the capital of Juba during the festivities. In the current exhibition context, it refers to this “Independence Day” and continues Kiwanga’s Flowers for Africa series.⠀ #kapwanikiwanga #flowersforafrica #southsudan #learningfrombigmistakes #galerietanjawagner #53orchard #newyork #artthatkeepsusgoing
