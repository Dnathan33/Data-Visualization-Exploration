🔥💯🔝One of the reasons that Madison Square is such a joy is that it is encircled by a variety of beautiful buildings. The Met Life Tower, erected in 1909, seven hundred feet (213 m) tall was modeled on the Campanile in St. Mark's Square in Venice. It sports a huge four-faced clock with chimes that play a measure by Handel every quarter hour. The Tower is connected by a bridge to a strangely stunted Art Deco office block called the North Building, begun in 1928 and intended to be a 100-story telescoping Tower that would have reclaimed "tallest building in the world "status from the Woolworth Building. The Greatest Depression set in, however, and the project was never realized. ==================================== ✅ Turn Post Notification on 📣 ✅ Follow, like and comment ✏ ✅ Tag your friends 👥 ==================================== #newyork #newyorkcity #ny #nyc #manhattan #centralpark #uppereastside #rockfellercenter#thebigapple #thecity #streetsofnewyork #newyorklife #lifeinnewyork
