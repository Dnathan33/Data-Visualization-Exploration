Well ladies and gentleman I give you the Dodge demon challenger! 840 horsepower, 9.65 seconds in a quarter mile and much more! I'm very impressed with what dodge has done to this! Everything is perfect down to the gears and wheel base set up! One bad mother fucker! But is it worth the price? To me no! But everybody has there opinions! Dodge you may be in some trouble when the new Shelby gt500 comes out! Or when the ZR1 does! But round of applause for dodge #badass #demon #newyork #dodge #challenger #instagram #instadaily #instacar #crazy #fresh #2018
