It's going to be the first Easter in 5 years and the first time in 13 years that I won't be visiting #NYC. Yes, it's my political stance against Trump's travel ban (If he wants to make America great again, he can do it without my money), but it pains me all the same because I truly love #NewYork with all my heart. ❤🗽 #Repost @earthpix Sunset in Central Park New York - thanks for tagging and sharing.
