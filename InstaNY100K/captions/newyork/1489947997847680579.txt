I attended mass for Palm Sunday before visiting a haunted abandoned asylum. I took my blessed palms cross with me and my stones. Those places are full of negativity and tormented souls, not about to get one attached to me. I say my peace at the end. For me, it was for of an exploration of a piece of history.  My sister caught creepy footage of Shadows... others saw apparitions. I'm NEVER going back there... It was too much for me. I felt lightheaded, anxious... like I had to get out of there. I saw a window in the basement and I was about to climb out cause everyone else wanted to stay but I stuck with the group. As we were looking for an exit, my niece stepped on an old rusty nail... Later on, I saw a bright room and we all headed that way... thank God there was an exit there! I realized I only want positive people and situations in my life ðŸ‘ŒðŸ˜†ðŸ’šðŸŒ» #palmsunday#cross#mass#church#protection#faith#peace#love#goodbadday#photo#p#photooftheday#new#newbeginnings#newyork#newyorkcity#newyorker#music#beats#tunes#life
