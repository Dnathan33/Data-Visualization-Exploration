What a beautiful day hiking yesterday in mid 60 degree weather.  Stated at the Tower behind Holiday Valley.  Hiked the Finger Lakes Trail to the Damaged Tornado Zone the up to South Pale Ale, Middle Pale Ale, then to the FLT Black Trail.  7.2 miles.  Great day.  Finished up with a nice Black Jack Oatmeal Nitro Stout at EBC
