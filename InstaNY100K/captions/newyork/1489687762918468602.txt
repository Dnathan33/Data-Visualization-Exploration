{Young Avengers: Style > Substance} Legacy isn't a dirty word...but it's an irrelevant one. It's not important what our parents did. It matters what WE do. Someone has to save the world. You're someone. Do the math. No pressure, right? As a figure from Loki's past emerges, Wiccan makes a horrible mistake that comes back to bite everyone on their communal posteriors. Fight scenes! Fake IDs! And plentiful feels! (aka "meaningful emotional character beats" for people who aren't on tumblr.) Young Avengers is as NOW! as the air in your lungs, and twice as vital. Hyperbole is the BEST! THING! EVER! #YoungAvengers #Style #Substance #MarvelNow #Marvel #marvelcomics #marveluniverse #wiccan #hulkling #missamerica #hawkeye #katebishop #loki #avengers #scarletwitch #marvelboy #newyork #galaxy
