ðŸ’™BEAUðŸ’™ Before & After #adopted . . Here is what his mum has to say about him... . . "Beau (previously known as Menron) is doing great and we're enjoying him so much. He's been an easy kitten, and he's learned not to jump on the other cats so much!  He loves our black lab Roxie, and he engages and plays with her. He loves his cat poles - one surrounded by windows (with a view of the bird feeders). He spends time there, in his bed, or on my lap when he's not playing.  He "helps" me do EVERYTHING, shoveling litter pans, sorting laundry, you name it! In other words, he's a WONDERFUL companion and family member." . . Thank you for such a wonderful update Brenda!
