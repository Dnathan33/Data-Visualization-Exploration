Heavy snowfalls this winter have the falls flowing at their greatest rate in recent years! . . #waterfall #newyork #shawangunks #nature #natureza #aov #artofvisuals #agameoftones #awesome_earthpix #illgrammers #killergrams #fatalframes #beautiful #sunrise #dawn #creatorclass #createcommune #createyourhype #myphotography #hsdailyfeature #weekly_feature #ig_masterpiece #beautiful #teamcanon #canonbringit #river #natgeo
