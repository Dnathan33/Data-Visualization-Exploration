This weeks lunch : meatless meat, with some chopped onions, and chopped garlic drizzled with Trader Joe's Sriracha BBQ sauce. With a side of sweet potato with some garlic powder, ghee and cinnamon. If you do the correct serving size , which is 1/3 cup of the meatless meat and 1.4 oz of sweet potato is 149 calories, 14 g of carbs, 5 g of fat , 11.6 g of protein. . . .  Would you guys like to see a food blog post on how I count the calories and the different recipes I normally do during the week for lunch prep ? Let me know guys. . . . #jujuxfit#julianasweightlossjourney#nyc#newyorkcity#newyork#fitnessjourney#fitness#weightloss#health#healthy#fitbit#fitbitflex2#vsg#vsgsurgery#vsgjourney#vsg#vsgcommunity#gastricsleeve#gastricsleevesurgery#gastricsleevecommunity#gastricsleevesupport#gastricsleevecommunity
