Yesterday's performance of 'Antigone'was dedicated to actress, acting teacher and founder of The New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts, Joan See who recently passed away. To the person who believed in me when I didn't believe in myself... I wouldn't be on this stage, in this city or in this industry if it wasn't for you,my dear. "Life is about removing plastic from your walls, furniture, and self so you dare to be exposed. Hiding does nothing; one must embrace life head-on" you said in our graduation one year ago...the best advice I've ever received. May your beautiful soul rest in peace now! #antigone #sophocles #stagelife #actress #joansee #rememberingjoan #mentor #love #actress #newyork
