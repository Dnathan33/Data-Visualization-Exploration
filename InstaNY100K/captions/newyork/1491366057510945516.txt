Hanging Valley.  According to geologists, Watkins Glen is one of two hanging valleys in the finger lakes region of New York. As glaciers receded, the finger lakes were originally north flowing rivers until debris clogged them forming lakes. Apparently the glaciers that carved out these lakes left the valley hanging high above the lake, with waters rushing through it carving out the gorge. --- #justcatchinglight #waterfallwednesday #waterfall #watkinsglen #statepark #newyork #watkinsglenstatepark #gorge #photooftheday #picoftheday #nikond750 #nikon #landscape #landscape_captures #landscapephotography #travel #travelusa #travelphotography #nature #naturephotography #cooltravelpix #reallyrightstuff #longexposure #fingerlakes #ilovenewyork #global_hotshotz
