Beauty beauty fresh skin. 👻  Hello everybody 👋 I hope you had a nice start in this week. I just wanted to share a few things with you. I am a fan of face mask but I'm really suspicious of masks from drug stores. Those which you make on your own and which are vegan are mostly better for the skin as we think! Anyways.  I tried this one Mask and it felt surprisingly good on my skin. After removing the skin was soft 👍@dm_balea
