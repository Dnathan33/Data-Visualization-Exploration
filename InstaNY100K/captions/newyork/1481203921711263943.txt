It's still hard to believe my last 5 speaking events have been SOLD OUT!!! Hard work truly pays the best interest. I'm in New York City, the Big Apple, in the city that never sleeps.  I can remember when it was just a dream wanting to be a great motivatonal speaker. Dreaming that one day I would be speaking in front of thousands of people. Now it has become my life's REALITY!!! Walt Disney once said "All your dreams can come true. If you have the courage to pursue them" I can honestly say that I had to leave FEAR at the front door, exit out the back door with DEDICATION and DETERMINATION and hit the road, never looking back!!!! Folks you will have to buckle up your seat belts. The road trip  from dream to reality can get a little bumpy and even ruff with some POP UP HATERS along the way. But you need to use them as fuel to get to your next destination. If  you stay consistent and don't quit you will arrive to your new REALITY, I'm sure of it. And I promise you there will be no REGRETS. Well that's not entirely true, it might be one. You may say this to yourself "Dam I  should have done this much sooner" LIVE YOUR DREAMS FOLKS..... I would like to thank Lee and Eric @barbershopconnect for this Amazing opportunity. And I would like to thank everyone who came out in the freezing cold to attend. And I can't forget my good friend Curtis Smith @xotics for believing in me. Thank you so much!!!! #barbercon #darrinlyons #motivation #purpose #motivationalspeaker #mentorship #changinglivesdaily #imblessed #livingmydream #giveback #passion #tanglesandlocks #newyork #education #godfirst #barbershopconnect
