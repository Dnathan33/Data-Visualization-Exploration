I don't love you anymore... ðŸ’”  I haven't taken a photo in New York City in ages. Today I ran an errand in TriBeCa and finally snapped something after the dismal weather here. Ironic that I finally started shooting again, considering how I'm in the process of figuring out where I'd like to move to that is NOT NYC... with a few ideas in mind.
