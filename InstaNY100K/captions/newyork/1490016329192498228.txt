#freecollege I am so goddamn blessed to be part of this era right now. This took a long time to happen, and I'm so proud of #newyork right now for doing the right thing. I don't have to sell my soul, my future kids or become a stripper to pay my tuition! None of you have to either. fuck yes! there's hope! Hopeeeee! #freetuition #newyork #freedom
