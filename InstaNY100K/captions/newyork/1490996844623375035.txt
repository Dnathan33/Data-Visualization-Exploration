I spent almost 24 h on the road.. experiencing horrible turbulence I was asking my self - wtf? What for I am going so far. But never let your fear decide! Today is my first day in this amazing city and It already brought me so much emotions! And of course the benefits of traveling alone - local people teach you amazing things. So here I am first day In New York and fishing ðŸŽ£ #newyork
