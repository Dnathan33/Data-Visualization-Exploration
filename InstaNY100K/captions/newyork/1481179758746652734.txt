4 Ticket Giveaway! By far, one of the greatest things about living in New York is the wide variety of live shows that hit city stages from month to month. We're always looking for unique performances that are perfect for the entire family or date night and can't wait to check out the new show @Circus1903 â€“ a circus re-imagined that's perfect for all ages! And if you aren't a fan of watching real animals as entertainment then you'll totally appreciate the usage of sensational puppetry throughout their show. #ontheblog we're offering readers the chance to attend opening night Wednesday, April 5th at 7pm at @msg.
