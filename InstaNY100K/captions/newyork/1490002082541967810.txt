A friend of mind long ago told me i need to first be happy and in love with myself before I can be with anyone else. This same friend told me to learn how to do things on my own first before doing anything with anyone else. I was once that woman who was able to go anywhere and do anything by myself but throughout the years I was in the verge of losing myself. I have the chance to find myself again and I'm loving every minute of it. I'm glad certain moments took place in my life as I now look at it as a blessing AND a lesson. Love yourself and love your own company before anything or anyone else. #loveyourself #qualityoverquantity #allaboutyou #love #workinprogress #positivevibes #lawofattraction #followyourheart #mondaymotivation #smile #behappy #beselfish #beinlovewithyourself #liveingmylife #newyork #nyc #instagram #ig #igers
