These stunning Georgian diamond earrings c.1800 are pretty much my 'perfect pair'. Set throughout with old mine and rose cut diamonds the elegant pendeloque design with central bow motif would perfectly complement the beribboned gowns of ladies of the period. Up for auction at Sotheby's NY on April 25th.
