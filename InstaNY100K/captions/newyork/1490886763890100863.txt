April 11th 1961 #BobDylan played his first ever official mainstream gig in #NewYork. He has played a few since!  I saw him play with the Foo Fighters in November 2006. Foos did an acoustic set and #Dylan did a full electric set. Took my dad to the show. . . . #60smusic #folkmusic #folk #blowininthewind #allalongthewatchtower #rocknroll #rockandroll #rockandrollroyalty #RockAndRollHallOfFame #rrhof #classicrock #70srock #60srock #legend #poet #songwriter #singer #livemusic #guitarplayer #harmonica #bluesplayer #blues #bluesmusic
