Last day in the city as I head to the desert for the rest of the month. I work the tradeshow circuit for a camera retailer and our biggest show always falls in April. Of course I prefer the laborious hours in the eighty degree weather vs the impending summer heat that reaches well over one hundred, but without fail.. I completely miss the quick tease of a New York spring. I get a glimpse, a few captivating strolls through our neighborhood park and some brunches with the dog once we're finally privileged with outside seating. Then, like clockwork, the desert calls. This is my sixth spring in New York and my fourth year leaving for the burnt foothills of Nevada. I've been writing a lot about precious moments lately and perhaps I'm lingering on these thoughts because my travel schedule is quickly picking up and my plans take my elsewhere, keeping my mind busy and my hands writing list after list. These slow mornings are addictive because there simply aren't enough of them. - #morningslikethese #coffeeshoptabletop #onthetable
