I'll be honest... I have in the past taken a lot for granted. Being told I'm appreciated, or how beautiful that one person thinks I am. Or being simply told "I love you" - after a while, it's like yeah... no shit you do, I've been with you long enough. But, once you stop hearing it, and stop having someone do all the little things... you realize how badly you truly crave someone to love you enough to do and say all those little things again.
