ðŸ’¥Tip Of The Day ðŸ’¥ ... When doing your analysis on any one currency pair, donâ€™t attempt to figure out whether itâ€™s a buy or sell, simply let the setup tell you a story. Let price prove to you that itâ€™s going to move within the direction you want it to. If a random spark of volatility appears within markets, donâ€™t be drawn in by the potential of making profits. Allow the structure of the trade to tell you a story of what happened in the past and what can happen within the future. Remember, the art of technical analysis states, we use past movement to predict future movement. Focus on depicting market structure through strict price action and assessing market momentum from there. Allow the setup to tell you a story, donâ€™t let the potential become your story. ... ðŸ’¥DON'T MISS OUT ON MY 50% DISCOUNT ON MY NEW TRAINING WEBINAR! ðŸ’¥Everything you need to know within the foreign exchange market is taught to you over the course of 3 weeks!
