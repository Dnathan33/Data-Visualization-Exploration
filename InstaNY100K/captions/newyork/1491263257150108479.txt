It's soon 50 years since the magical 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' record was released. .🌈💂🏻 . "It had to be just right. We tried and I think succeeded in achieving what we set out to do. If we hadn't then it wouldn't be out now." - John Lennon, 1967. . . Never give up on your dreams. Is it right. Do it anyway.  Try. Try again.  #lovewins #investorsatheart💟
