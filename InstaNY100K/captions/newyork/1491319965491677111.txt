We're the only one Bar on Washington heights tapping this Limited Beer ,  Brooklyn Black Ops , Join us @bar180nyc get one of the "Limited Beer " . Brooklyn Black Ops (2016 vintage) is an 11,6% imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels and re-fermented in the bottle with champagne yeast. Generous bourbon in the scent and taste with undertones of dark chocolate, coffee and a pinch on vanilla. I've wanted to taste this for years and now was the perfect time for it. Cheers!  #beerporn  #Fortheloveofbeer #CraftBeer #beergeek #beerlove #beerporn #beerstagram #beeradvocate #beertography #BecauseBeerMatters #craftbeer #drinkingcraft #drinklocal #instabeerofficial #craftbeer #craftbeernation #craftbeerlife #craftbeercommunity #craftbeerculture #nyc #Newyork #washingtonheights
