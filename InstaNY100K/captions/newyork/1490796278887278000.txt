L❤ve is being together for 46 years (PI) There was just something about the way she touched his hand, the tender look in his eyes when he smiled at her.... It was 1967 when they met for the first time at Jolanda's workplace. She worked at an advertisement agency and Clyde was a freelance artist. The first thought Jolanda had was "I want him”, Clyde thought she had beautiful hair. He knew right away that she was “the one” because of her sassiness, everything about her was fresh.  Jolanda: “We have different personalities, I am the crazy-nutty type and he is a gentle man, he is quiet, reserved and intellectual. When we started going out, no one thought it would click between us because our personalities are so different. Look at us now, 46 years later we are still going strong!” Jolanda continues: “We got together in '69. I tricked him into a date. He was supposed to see an art movie with my boss, but she couldn't make it. I decided not to tell him this. I showed up instead at the corner of 34th and 5th ave and we went to the movie. I didn't understand much of the movie because, like I said, it was an art movie. Two weeks later he asked me out, it took him two whole weeks to decide. We started to get to know each other and then it happened.” 🚩What was it that made you fall in love with him? J:”When you are young and attractive man are looking for one thing and one thing only. He looked pass that, he realized that I had a brain, that I was smart, that I could “make” a good conversation. It wasn’t about the superficial stuff. We had long conversations and we realized that we weren’t as different as everyone thought we were. We like sports, we played all kinds of sports together, so you grow and you become one person really.” 🚩Are you still in Love after all these years?  J:"Yes, we bicker because we are older, but he is a part of me. We do everything together, we go everywhere together. Someone asked me why I don’t have a cellphone and I said, I don’t need a cellphone, the person I want to be with is always with me.” ❤To be continued in PART II  #Lovebyice #love #loveis #loveislove #lovecouple #lovestory #lovestories #NewYork #NY #Lovers #Spread #give
