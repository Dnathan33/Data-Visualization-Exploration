#Repost @sugamamas_treats Friends, Please Support this Great Cause!!! ・・・ Good Morning, for the past 7 years I have donated Easter baskets, clothes, shoes, cooked dinners, clothes drive, toy drive and more to homeless families affected by HIV/AIDS and the less fortunate. I know its very last minute but I'm reaching out asking for your support. Maimonides Children's Hospital, just reached out to me to donate baskets to the children fighting for their lives and fighting Cancer. Allll I'm asking is for a monetary donation of $20 to $30 if you cannot purchase the items on this flyer. Please help me this year you can eamil, DM or call 347-757-7017 , thank you! #support #donate #happyeaster #lessfortunate #homeless #cancersuck #blogger #smile #womensupportingwomen #fight #love #boys #girls #teamwork #sugamamastreats #nyc #newyork #brooklyn #childrenshospital #supportthiscause #support #bloggers
