ITOLOGIE N.29 - from tomorrow on www.itologie.com. The general agreement with my sister, who's birthday will be on April 29, is that when I visit my mom and her in Trieste, she goes for the morning walk with Ito and Abelle, I go at lunch and before dinner. We live by the harbour., not far the Audace Pier, where the Allied Troops landed freeing the city from Nazis. Audace means bold. Anyway, the two Welshies love to walk there early in the morning and they politely sit on the stone bench, waiting for their treat. On Sunday, it's my turn to walk them because it's the only day my sister can rest. Two days ago, the east-north-east wind, the Bora, was blowing, almost peeling the surface of the sea, painting the tips of the waves in white and a hint of dawn pink. Sincerely, no painting can express my feeling of still perfection of that moment. #welshie #welshterrier #terrier #portrait #dog #instadog #illustration #graphicdesign #trieste #milano #newyork #art #adriatic #itologie
