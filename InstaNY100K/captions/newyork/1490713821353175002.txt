Happy Spring Break! Here is this week's Tuesday Teaching Tip - If you're able to, take your kid to work one day over their break. This allows them to see what you do all day. It is also an excellent opportunity to talk about what they want to be when they grow up and what path might lead them there! . . . . . #KidsCreative #KC #SpringBreak #Education #NYCKids #NonProfit #ArtEducation #MusicEducation #ArtEducation #PeaceEducation #Bronx #Manhattan #NYC #NewYork #NewYorkCity #Teaching
