🌈💎🌖"spherical space" • 😍#olafureliasson is showing at #tanyabonakdar and will be exhibiting at the #venicebiennale  ________________________  @studioolafureliasson: "Drawing inspiration from the mesmerising relationship between internal motion and external shape exhibited by schooling fish, the static surface of the work appears to be a flurry of movement. The #geodesic lines of the sphere naturally draw the eye upwards in a whirlwind of tints and shapes, and even the slightest movement by the viewer alters the perceived alignment of spirals and triangles, creating the illusion of constant change. The viewer recognises her movements through the room in the motion she perceives in and on the sphere" • **This work is sadly not up in nyc, currently on display at #lunerouge in #ibiza // #rainbowbridge at #tanyabonakdargallery is up until 4.22.17 _______________________ #repost from @vickysanz1  _______________________ @tanyabonakdargallery @labiennale #newyork #nyc #art #artist #gallery #contemporaryart #lightart #sphericalspace #sphere #disco #discoball #photography #photooftheday #instaart
