"Nothing's easy" has become sort of a #mantra since moving to #newyork. It's not an admission of defeat, but a reminder that we didn't leave the comfort of the south for the ease of #citylife. We left to gain new life experiences. It also reminds us to take each crazy turn of events in stride and appreciate each moment more because damnit, you worked hard to earn it! #success #makeit #bebold #nycgram #newyorkcitylife
