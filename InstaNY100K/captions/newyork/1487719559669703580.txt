04.07.16 Still feeling a bit of the cold going away. My nose needs to be blown constantly and the dust in the studio isn't helping much! Most of that, however, came from moving this week. After getting back from Toronto I took everything off the walls and moved to the other side of our studio. I think it looks amazing. It's already the 4th home of the brand in 2.5yrs but a change of scenery is good. Nothing helps inspire change like getting out of your comfort zone. Moving spaces is not getting out of your comfort zone. But most of the things on our plate right now are. I meet people all the time who are frustrated because their business isn't growing, but won't change anything because they're scared it won't work. Change sparks evolution, fear brings motivation, and risk will set you apart from the crowd. Meetings and development happening today.
