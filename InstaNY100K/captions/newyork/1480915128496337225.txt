I remember being on the #subway when I lived in #newyork and seeing this quote on the train. It was a great reminder that integrity matters. It also makes a good night's rest possible. I know majority of us desire #success ,and I truly hope our #dreams come true. I just pray you don't trade in your soul to acquire it. If you do, you'll never be able to truly enjoy it. You'll soon discover it wasn't worth your #peace ! Good night #beautiful people. #tuesday #night #success fitness #motivation #tlifec
