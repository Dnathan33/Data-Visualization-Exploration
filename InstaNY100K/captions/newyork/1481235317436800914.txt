Attention All REALTORS®: NYSAR has activated a call for action for New York REALTORS® to sign a petition in support of a statewide, first time homebuyer’s savings account. If this proposal is signed into law, first time homebuyers in New York State could deposit a $5,000 income tax credit into a tax-free savings account. Participants can apply the savings toward the closing costs and down payment of their first home purchase. Please take action now by telling officials in Albany that you support the NY First Home proposal: http://nyfirsthome.com/  #callforaction #firsttimehomebuyers #ourfuture #newyork #homeownership #nyfirsthomeproposal #Realtors #LIRealtors #longislanders #newyorkers #homeinitiative #supporthomeownership
