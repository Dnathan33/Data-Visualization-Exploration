Not wanting to trash it. I hit the internet and in my first search, I found  kintsukuroi, fixing broken ceramics with gold.  Perfect.  My #accident has now become a #workofart.

"Kintsugi is a Japanese technique for repairing broken pottery with seams of gold. The word means “golden joinery” in Japanese. This repair work was done using a lacquer or resin that was sprinkled with powered gold. (The process is also known as kintsukuroi, which means “golden repair.”) "The most common history I’ve found for this practice dates to the 15th century when a shogun needed a broken bowl repaired. Over time, these repaired pottery pieces became so prized that people would intentionally break items in order to have them repaired this way."
