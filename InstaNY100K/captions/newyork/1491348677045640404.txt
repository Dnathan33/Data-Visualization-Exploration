Do you get high or low from alcohol? 🍸When out and about - do you drink whatever you like and 'deal' with it, or do you choose carefully in an attempt to keep bloodsugar at bay...🙄 I try to stick to dry wine, champagne - or vodka drinks (san mixers), but it's hard to manage my sugar perfectly while drinking. #t1d #drinks #cocktails #diabetes #type1strong #whattodo #t1dlife #choices #instadrink #diabuddies #happydiabetic #hypoglycemia #hyperglycemia #carefulnow #highorlow #newyork #havesomefun #tomorrowisanewday #lifeisbeautiful #besafe #pickyourspot
