This summer I will be documenting Joe & Caroline's wedding in Crested Butte, Colorado. When we set up our first meeting they informed me that they lived in Brooklyn and wouldn't be able to meet with me until the wedding. Fortunately I knew that my wife and I would be headed to New York to visit her brother and sister in law that live there. So it only made sense that we would get together and take some photos.
