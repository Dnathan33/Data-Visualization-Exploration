I'm exhausted and my head hurts, but I wouldn't do it any different. Had a wonderful weekend with my brother, met some pretty awesome people, won at some euchre, had the best cheeseburger ever, and a little too much to drink. It was a weekend I won't forget. Thank you all for making a girl feel welcomed. Until next time Bago. 🎒👟✈️ #travel #americanairlines #ohareairport #nextstop #newyork #journeyhome #bagoweekend #stacksiblings #jessicasimpsonluggage #adidas #calia #goinghome
