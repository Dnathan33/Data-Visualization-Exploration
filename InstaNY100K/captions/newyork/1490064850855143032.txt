Support young black film makers!!! My girl @jareewright is producing her very first film, Bear, a short thriller about a droll exotic dancer, his lovestruck stalker, and his dead father's ghost. If you're looking to help a sista out click the link in my bio and DONATE!!! Any amount helps and is appreciated. Remember, there's nothing better than supporting your own.
