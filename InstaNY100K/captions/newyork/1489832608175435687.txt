It was a rainy, cold, dreary day this past Wednesday morning but despite all that, this city is radiant. Just look at the Freedom Tower (or technically One World Trade Center) standing so tall and modern behind the marvel that is the Brooklyn Bridge from the 1800's but equally as important to this city. It doesn't get any better than this. #freedomtower #oneworldtradecenter #brooklynbridge #nyc #manhattan #manhattanskyline #ny #newyork #newyorknewyork #ilovenyc #iloveny #newyorkphotography #rainyday #greysky
