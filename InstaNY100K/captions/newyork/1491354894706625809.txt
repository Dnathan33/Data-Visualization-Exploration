A long three flight climb (in all fairness, it was an escalator ride) to the tallest above ground subway station in the world richly rewarded with this view of Manhattan. Love NYC any time, but especially on a beautiful clear day like yesterdayðŸ’• #nyc #brooklyn #gowanus #manhattan #awesomeview #newyork
