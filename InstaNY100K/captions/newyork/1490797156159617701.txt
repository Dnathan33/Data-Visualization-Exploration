I don't know why I feel so sad right now. I do know I'm tired of traveling alone.  Maybe it's just the sadness of an ending before a new beginning.  First time to New York, and then afterwards, a whole new story begins. Let's go. 🖖🏾, everyone.  #newbeginnings #endings #sadness #travel #businesstrip #fieldwork #exhausted #missingpeople #newyork #firsttime #adventure #woc
