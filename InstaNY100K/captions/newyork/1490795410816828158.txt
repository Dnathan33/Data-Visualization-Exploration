I have heard many times in science or astronomy courses that "we are made up of stardust." And that idea never really stirred up much excitement in me. Until recently as I begin to realize more and more how profound this really is. That each and every bit of your being has been thee life giving essence to many civilizations and planetary bodies. That each piece of you has been what the sun is to us. And if any bit of you had never existed, life would have also seized to exist for so many others back into the beginning of time. And as we dig deeper into this idea we begin to realize that every galaxy is home to approximately 100 billion stars in the same way our brain is home to approximately 100 billion nerve cells. Connecting this with the age old hermetic axiom "as above, so below" we see that each of us truly is a galactic body co-creating a universal experience. • • • • • • • #roamtheplanet #pnwlife #heatercentral #beach #love #moodygrams #gearednomad #createcommune #aov #fff #ig_color #way2ill #portraitpage #featuremeofh #bravogreatphoto #fatalframes #weeklyfeature #eclectic_shotz #vsco #lensbible #discoverearth #natgeo #awesomepix #ourplanetdaily #moodyports #visualambassadors #gramslayer #paris #newyork #aovportraits
