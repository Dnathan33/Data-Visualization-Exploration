Yesterday afternoon, I was talking to my best friend of 16 years over the phone. She was in New Haven and I was in Staten Island. Next thing ya know, she she's on a 2 hour train ride to the city so that we can yippety yap in person even though she's a busy and often fatigued doctor. I hopped right back on the ferry and trekked to Grand Central to welcome her.  We ended up splitting a bottle of wine in the east village and both expressed how girl dates are the best dates. No man around to inhale the food. Just wining and dining. Talking and laughing. That's love. #bestfriends #love #wine #wineandcheese #family #newyork #eastvillage #manhattan #nyc #trains #friendship #girls #girlnight #weekend
