An impression from the recent days in NY: Chrysler in the clouds. I expect that some kind of crisis is coming after coming back to normal life after 6 months of constant travelling. A turn of 360 degrees. Crisis of place, time zone, season and many other things. #chrysler #building #newyork #berlin #cloudy #skyscrapers #spring #morning #travelling #finished #archilovers #architektur #architecture #places #blackandgray #blackandwhite
