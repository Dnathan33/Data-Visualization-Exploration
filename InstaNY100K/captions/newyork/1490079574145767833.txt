Try to stay off the comments section man that shits depressing saw a veteran today damn near lost everything and hear I am complaining about the shit that I don't have the shit that makes me mad the shit I can't get passed gotta laugh at it stressings not gonna get me back to where I need to be surrounded by people that got my back since I was three and everyone I picked up along the way that saved the day made my day reminding me we don't have it all that bad. Pray.  No matter what you've got going on There's always a way out thinking you got it wrong Let it play out for now just play along  And when it seems like hell  Help flip the script for someone else You're not alone  #newyork #losangeles #originalartist #writersofinstagram #artwork #film #filmmaker #photography #photographs #cinematography #cinema #sundance #sundancefestival #tribeca #independentfilm #tribecafilmfestival #screenwriter #writer #originalart #music #lyrics #lyricist #rap #rhymes #poetry #poems #creatives #wideangle
