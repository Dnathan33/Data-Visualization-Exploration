Wednesday's Wisdom... Along side the brands logo 🙏 the classic L-sit is an isometric exercise that works your entire body while emphasizing the abdominal muscles. 💪  In order to perform an L-sit, you’ll need a strong core, strong arms and better than average flexibility in your hamstrings.  Recommendation: Learn the L-sit by practicing on parallel bars, push-up bars, or even dumbbells (although you can practice this move with no equipment). #salute💯🙏💪🔥 #allyouneedisyou  #holdyourown #holdmyown #barcodefitness #salute  #livelovelife #barcodefitness #perspective #loner #rest #support  #cardio #chest #bodyweight #exercise  #fitness  #motivation #muscle #progress #training #nike  #trainhard  #noweights #workouts #calisthenics #newyork #activewear
