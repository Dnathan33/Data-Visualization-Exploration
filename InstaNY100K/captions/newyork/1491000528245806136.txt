I was fortunate enough to dogsit in Forest Hills, Queens this week and witness some truly beautiful architecture. It's an area with incredible history (home of The Ramones, Simon and Garfunkel, Helen Keller, etc). They have a Shake Shack. And their main road through town is even called Austin Street. I spent the day exploring through Forest Hills Gardens, a neighborhood consisting mostly of English Tudor style houses (more like castles). More posts to come! . . . . . #foresthills #queens #foresthillsgardens #englishcountrygarden #newyork #nyc #newyorkcity #olympusem5 #springtime #tudorhouse #austinstreet #puritanave
