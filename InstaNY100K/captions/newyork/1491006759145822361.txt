Look at this gorgeous girl who is looking for her furrrever home. Located in NYC #newyork 💗🐱 #Repost @puppykittynycty with @repostapp ・・・ Bella is looking for her happy ever after. She was a domesticated cat, thrown out in winter into a cat colony, and due to her shyness, caretakers weren't sure if she was feral or friendly. When they discovered she was friendly, she was rescued but has been bounced around since. When you hold out your hand, she gently sniffs then gently rubs. She's a smaller little one, and needs to be an only cat. I imagine her foster or forever home with another solo human who can appreciate the tough life she has endured. You must meet her in person to feel her sweetness. DM @artemisprojectnyc or @clover_cats_nyc to hear all about Baby Bella! #tortiesofinstagram #tortie #tortiecat #torties #derp #derpface
