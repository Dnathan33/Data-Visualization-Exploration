Today, 105 years ago on Wednesday, April 10th 1912, the world's largest liner, the R.M.S. Titanic left Southampton for her maiden voyage to New York. 923 passengers boarded the ship in Southampton. The Titanic departed at 12 pm. Minutes later she passed the moored liners "New York" and "Oceanic". Her huge displacement caused both smaller ships to be lifted by a water bulge and then drop into a though. "New York's" mooring cables couldn't take the sudden strain and snapped, swinging her stern towards Titanic. The tugboat "Vulcan" took New York under tow, and Titanic's engines were ordered to be put "full astern". Both ships avoided a collision  by a matter of 4 feet (1.2 m). Titanic's departure delayed for about an hour. She then headed for Cherbourg and arrived 4,5 hours later. Because Cherbourg lacked docking facilities for a ship of Titanic's size, two White Star tenders, SS Traffic and Nomadic, were used to transport passengers from shore to ship. 274 passengers boarded the ship (among them were American millionaire John Jacob Astor with his wife Madeleine Force Astor and Molly Brown). 24 left the ship. The Titanic weighed anchor and left for Queenstown at 8 pm... PIC 1: The Titanic during departure from Southampton.
