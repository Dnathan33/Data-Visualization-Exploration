Really proud of this presentation and how yummy it was! A lovely simple breakfast with big flavors.... I made a new york classic of lox and eggs so it has sauteed onions, lox, and soft scrambled eggs i topped it with capers, parsley, and creamcheese mixed with fresh chopped chives and scallions 😍👌🏻 #studyabroad#dcu#ireland#breakfast#brunch#nyclassic#newyork#jewish#loxandeggs#sauteedonions#capers#parsley#presentation#softscrambledeggs#eggs#creamcheese#chives#scallions#scallioncreamcheese#bigflavors#yummm#simple#KISS#Keepitsimple
