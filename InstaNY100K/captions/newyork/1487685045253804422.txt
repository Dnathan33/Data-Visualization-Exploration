"Come along with me to my little corner of the world, Dream a little dream in my little corner of the world, You'll soon forget that there's any other place, Tonight, my love, we'll share a sweet embrace, And if you care to stay in my little corner of the world, I always knew that I'd find someone like you, So welcome to my little corner of the world, And if you care to Stacy in our little corner of the world, We could hide away in our little corner of the world, We always knew that we'd find someone like you, So welcome to our little corner of the world" #mycorneroftheworld #music #lyrics #anitabryant #yolatengo #heart #hearts #heartseverywhere #heartagram #ifoundmyheartinnyc #ifoundmyheart #iseethesignsoflove #ihavethisthingwithhearts #loveyou #lovewall #love #jgoldcrown #nolita #ny #newyorkcity #nyc #newyork_instagram #newyork_ig #newyork #grafitti #graffitiart #streetartnyc #streetphotography #streetartnyc #nycstreetart @jgoldcrown
