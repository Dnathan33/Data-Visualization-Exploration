Catching those morning rays. #commuteforcreativity day 14 Today's word is Alive: That feeling you get when you see the people you love most in life succeed. The crisp winter morning air as you breath through your nostrils and fill your lungs with that sweet smell of fresh snow. The wind rushing around you while driving down the motorway on a motorcycle. The pain in the pit of your stomach when someone you cared deeply for dies. Pure, unbridled elation, tears of joy, and the deep longing sadness you feel for those you've lost. #whatwordsmeantome shot with #fzeros lens
