Project Petals will be honored at the @nycservice @nycmayor @nycmayorsoffice Mayoral Service Recognition Ceremony on April 27th. The Mayor’s Office selected our organization, volunteers, and board out of the top 5% of 3200 nominated in New York City to receive this honor. Our Executive director and Founder Alicia White will be awarded as well.  Thank you to all our amazing volunteers who help us make effective changes in communities. Thank you to the communities we’ve worked in for allowing our organization to advocate and make improvements with you. #NYC #mayor #improvements #newyork #service #award #Ceremony  #mayor #communities #Mayoral #projectpetals #volunteers #community #architecture #engineering #environment #nonprofit #nonprofits #projectpetals
