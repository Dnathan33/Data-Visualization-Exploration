What you're looking at is the view from the seats I'm going to have in August at Yankee Stadium against the Red Sux. The tickets are $700 a piece. I wouldn't care if they were more. I've dreamed about seeing the Yankees in New York since I was a kid. This year it's finally going to happen. Not even going to lie I'll probably cry lol I'm right next to the dugout 5 rows up from the field!!! #yankees #newyork #questfor28begins #bronxbombers #newyorkyankees
