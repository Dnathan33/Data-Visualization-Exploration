‚Ä¢ Feeling a little wonky today { insert blaming Mercury retrograde here }, but looking back on this photo I took a couple weeks ago has me thinking: This building was erected in 1929, literally in the middle of the Great Depression- when everyone thought the sky was falling- and now here it stands almost 90 years later, still beautiful, still striking enough to make me stop my walk and pause to snap a picture... To me, it feels symbolic. A sign that the work we do in our dark and difficult times may, in the moment, feel frivolous or pointless, but the products of that work are everlasting. When life challenges us and we respond with strength, that strength endures. üôè‚ú® . . . . . . . #helmsleybuilding #nycarchitecture #newyork #nyc #mercuryretrograde #musings #thoughts #symbolism #messages #flow #strength #endurance #perseverance #optimism #yoga #yogithoughts #yogini
