In honor of National Pet Day.  Gone but certainly never forgotten. Bruschi... He got me through some of the toughest days in LA and Austin TX.  And I still believe he planned the path to get me back to LA.  He lived a short 7 years, but what an impact he made on me and everyone who met him.  His spirit still thrives today. #nationalpetday2017
