ðŸ”¦let's be clear? These two highly incredibly, highly complicated little beings are my guiding lights. Good and bad they are my moral compass. They have my heart and as challenging as this 9 months of #worldschooling #unschooling are....I wouldn't trade it for the world ðŸŒŽ about the time we're all ready to give in......magic happens. Milo can navigate the #newyork #subway system better than I can and Sam has more emotional intelligence than anyone I've ever come in contact with. Oh, and we bought a new flashlight today ðŸ”¦ðŸ˜‚ cause no matter what, fail or success of a day, this clan shines bright. #unicorn #unicorns #shonebright #bethelight ðŸ¦„âœ¨âœ¨âœ¨ #thisis10 #thisis5 #thisis38 #nomads #nomadiclife #wenomadwehappy #mommanomad #travelfam
