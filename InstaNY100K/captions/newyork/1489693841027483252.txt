Love this team and love making headlines. In a Bloomberg TV exclusive, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard appeared on Daybreak Asia. For more than 10 minutes (a near eternity for TV news), my superb co-anchors Shery Ahn, Kathleen Hays and I asked him his reaction to U.S. unemployment falling to 4.5% and a near-decade low, changes to the 2017 rate hike path and the Fed unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. Bullard said to something "reasonable." I pressed him on that and he said $2 trillion. He added he sees US GDP growing at 2% for 2017.
