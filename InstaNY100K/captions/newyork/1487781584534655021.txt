This New York loft renovation by @raad_studio is perfection ðŸ‘Œ As written by the architects: "A unique room inside an iconic New York building was carefully treated to emphasize the muscular beauty of the ancient building skeleton itself. In a project that was almost more about taking away than adding, the interventions were meant to create a clean backdrop for the roughness of the building shell. Building systems, storage, and lighting were all added in delicate balance to bring out the character of the space." ðŸ“¸ @raad_studio
