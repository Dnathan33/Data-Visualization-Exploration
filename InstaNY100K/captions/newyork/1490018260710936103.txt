I'm just a girl standing in front of a salad, asking it to be a donut 🥗🍴🍩 • Healthy habits not restrictions. Yesterday I binged on pizza, candy, popcorn and soda (yeah, me!)... today I don't feel an ounce of regret. • Why? Because I'm in control of my life and I know eating healthy requires living a little. • 7 days of strict dieting is like training hard 7 days a week with no rest days. • Eat the damn donut. #JourneyStrong
