Thank you to everyone who made this collection possible @chewy_choi @banana.bew.bew @thelittlemoomaid @real_cynthia_ ☝️Aesthetically and conceptually inspired by  #방탄소년단 BTS's and @lumpens productions' Wings 💡 On Demian: I've always placed much emphasis on aesthetics - from sets, props, fashion, and art direction to color correction, light editing, and special effects... I guess what people see as inorganic, I see as efforts and production values. Demian is not meant to be interpreted in a linear fashion. As a matter of fact, there is no plot. Rather, it is a collection whose concepts and motifs must be understood in conjunction with every edit. Never let meaning overshadow aesthetic. Meanings are bound by lingual and social constraints, while beauty can be appreciated by everyone. Here's to #takingBackAesthetics 🌸 Props to the Kpop industry for all of its aesthetic glories 🙏 . . . #photography #photooftheday #surrealism #photoshoot #photographer #editorial #photoshop #newyork #nyc #ny #manhattan #wings #bts #army #방탄소년단 #collection #words #commentary
