We made it to New Hampshire yesterday! Where it's still winter :/ . We (me only, Sam was not happy about it) decided to avoid tolls on this trip so we ended up riding the I81 most of the way and then cut straight east through NY and VT. I've never taken the rig through mountains before and I just want to take a moment to thank Ford for the tow/haul mode. It accelerates and brakes more aggressively but more importantly it downshifts for you too, so you don't go careening down a mountain! . I mean, the ride was still hella stressful but not horrible. And now we're nice and warm, hanging out with family!
