Albrecht D端rer (1471-1528) - Melencolia I, 1514, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Melencolia I belongs to a group of three so called Master engravings executed around the same time. The other two are Knight, Death and the Devil (which for some reason reminds me of Ingmar Bergman's film The Seventh Seal) and my favourite saint, Saint Jerome in His Study. D端rer did not intend them to be a cycle but they do correspond to the three kinds of virtue of medieval scholasticism - moral, theological and intellectual. Melencolia is a depiction of the intellectual situation of the artist and thus could be seen as a spiritual self-portrait of D端rer. In a medieval philosophy, melancholy, one of the four humours, was associated with black gall and the least desirable. Renaissance has redeemed it, linking it with creative genius but at the same time making the self-conscious artist aware of its potential risks. An influential treatise the De Occulta Philosophia of Cornelius Agrippa of Nettesheim, may hold the key to the understanding of number One in the title. Creativity in the arts was the realm of imagination, considered the first and lowest in the hierarchy of the three categories of human genius, followed by reason and the most precious - spirit. It may be a paradox to see this image of powerless and doubting artist exemplifying D端rer himself at the absolute peak of his creative powers. But then the search for perfection never ends and hence the caliper and all the tools of geometry. #art #print #master #genius #painting #german #germany #europe #durer #beauty #imagination #craft #philosophy #religion #civilisation #culture #instaart #instaphoto #inspiration #melancholy #artist #achievement #newyork
