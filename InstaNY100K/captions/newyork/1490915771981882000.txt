Awestruck in Pamukkale with the beauty and life in that place, I had to get my hands dirty (or rather clean?) with the sand/minerals. Saw some people rubbing it all over their body... legend has it that the sand heals/improves skin! No wonder I witnessed complete beauty regimes there! Would love to go back ❤️❤️
