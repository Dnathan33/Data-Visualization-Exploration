I am grateful; April is finally here with blessings for me and my family, and what was simply an idea is a fact: Rapid Realty South Bronx. I do not know how to express how proud I feel of myself. I fell but rise like the phoenix and am now the owner of my business. I want to thank Rodney, Anthony, Ricco, and Carlos for the opportunity to see in me more than just what I can put on the table. Thanks to all my family who have supported me ever since I told them the news. And the most important thing: that Diegito already has something that belongs to him, and I can give him even more than he deserves and needs. This is just the beginning of my new life. Thanks to God and my saint for giving me so many obstacles to give me victory in the end, so I could see how strong I am. This life is for the warrior, and I fight every battle to be the best. God gives the worst battles to his best soldiers, and I am still a true warrior in this life against the winds and tide. My Mantra " Know that the greatest goddess was once the wounded woman. She has known pain and through it she has found strength. Just like you can. Take all your battle scars and wear them with pride. Youâ€™re a survivor".#realestatelife #rapidlife #realestateagent #realestateinvestor #bronx #rapidfranchise #Sobro #RapidSobro #RRSB #pianodistrict #newyorkcity #newyork #wehiring #wehire #realestateexperts
