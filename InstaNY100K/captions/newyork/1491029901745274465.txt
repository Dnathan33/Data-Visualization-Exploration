Finally catching up on my blog! The first half of our trip is ready for your reading enjoyment (link in bio) Grab a cup of tea ☕️ and hear about a few things I learned from London 🇬🇧 & my not so secret plans to move there someday. 😆 ps: my birthday is tomorrow! I'm going to wake up twenty seven! I just need you guys to tell me- is 27 considered mid or late twenties? 😳
