From the Empire Chrysler / Laurent Dequick  Available in giant premium perspex plexi finish (100 x 100 cm)  Taking photographs of areas where there is life involves depicting, not the least by evocation, the time passing. "My study is the feeling, the emotion which results from the juxtaposition of multiple moments." In general photography fixes a given moment forever, this artist adds these moments up by superimposing the shots. The offset accumulation creates a vibration and recreates chronophotography. Slow motion and dispersed movements give a new and frenzied vision of urban activities.  #yellowkorner #yellowkornerid #art #portrait #photography #urban #newyork
