Few gigs coming up! And there are some NYU events that I'll be involved in. On April 21st, Andy Milne Ensemble will have a showcase from 9:30 - 10:15pm. We will be playing some fat compositions by Andy. Also I am fortunate enough to be a part of NYU Jazz Orchestra past year. On May 8th, I will be fortunate to make a debut at the Blue Note Jazz Club sharing the stage with special guest, Randy Brecker, playing music of Brecker Brothers. If you know me well from the New School days, you know how much I was obsessed with Michael Brecker. So this one is going to be very emotional and special for me. NYU students! Come out if you can! . . . . #jazz #newyork #newyorkcity #newyorker #newyorkuniversity #newyorkmusicians #NYUevents #NYC #NYU #livejazz #events #mbase #jazzconcert #daily #bluenote #randybrecker #andymilne #music #nycjazz #음스타그램 #음악 #뉴욕 #재즈 #재즈기타 #공연 #데일리 #일상 #뮤지션 #뉴요커 #뉴욕스타그램
