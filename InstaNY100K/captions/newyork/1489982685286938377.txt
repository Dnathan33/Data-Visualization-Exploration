Part of the fabric of the street life in New York, especially in Summers is street chess. This variant of the board game become popular in the late 1960â€™s and is basically a 5-minute game played with a timer for each move. With chess tables being found in most public parks in the city, one can easily find chess hustlers or players who compete the board game with you for a couple dollars attracting tourists and increasing the vibrancy of the parks.  #washingtonsquarepark  #streetchess #speedchess #publicparks #urbandesign #urbanism #newyork #newyorklife #mumbai2newyork #blankspacelab #blankslatedesignstudio #bsds
