This is how future New Yorkers look like, at least according to DKNY S/S'17 collection.  For this season, the label's inspiration comes from imagination on the future style of the New York people. Contrast between soft and hard, construction and deconstruction are combined with contemporary and urban sexiness in this collection.  #DKNY #NewYork #NewYorker #SS17
