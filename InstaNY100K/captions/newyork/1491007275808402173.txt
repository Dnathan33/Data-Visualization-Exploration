Max is the grandson of Oscar Tucci, legendary owner of the world famous Delmonico’s restaurant at 56 Beaver Street in New York City’s Financial District, and author of Oscar Delmonico Historic Epicurean Book. . .  Photo by @zackmiklos. Thanks Zack. . .  Delmonico’s opened in 1837 and was the first fine dining restaurant in the United States. Dishes now seen in restaurants all across America such as Lobster Neuberg, Eggs Benedict, and Delmonico’s Steak were pioneered at Delmonico’s on Beaver Street. . .  Oscar Wilde, the celebrated Irish playwright and frequent patron of Delmonico’s said “indeed, the two most remarkable bits of scenery in the United States are undoubtedly Delmonico’s and the Yosemite Valley; and the former place has done more to promote a good feeling between England and America than anything else in this country.” . .  #delmonicos #delmonicosteak #financialdistrict #westvillage #restaurant . .
