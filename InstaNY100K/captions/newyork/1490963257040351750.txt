singing at the UN building, shopping, partying, practicing, singing in cathedrals, working with four other choirs from different states, performing at Carnegie hall, watching two broadway shows, making new friends, working with people from broadway, going across the brooklyn bridge, eating yummy food, going to central park, going to the MET, going to little italy, riding the subway, going to Ellis island, going to China town, seeing the 9/11 memorial, going to the statue of liberty. you could say this was an AMAZING trip. I'm forever grateful that I could be part of this experience. I've learned so much on this trip and saw so many new things. Being able to travel and do what I love most with my friends is awesome. New York will forever have a special place in my heart. ❤🗽🇺🇸
