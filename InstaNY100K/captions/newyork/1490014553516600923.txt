It's been a strange sort of day today. I got up, had breakfast then hopped on the train to essayville and spent around two hours or so writing that. I then did some yoga and an extra weighted leg workout, got ready, ate lunch, headed into town and here we are after a trip round tkmax and Tesco. It's felt like I've done loads and nothing at the same time. Very weird. How is everyone else doing this Monday? #monday #mondaymusings #mensshirt #studying #studentnurse #essaywriting #workout #yoga #legday #tesco #tkmax #foodie #instadaily #instamood #like #lunch #womensfashion #style #blogger #photojournal #photodiary #brooklyn #newyork #berlin #tokyo
