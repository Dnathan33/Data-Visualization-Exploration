⚜️ #BRAVIARY got one good looking design!! This bird looks like it can hunt anything and reality could be not that different... It's ATTACK stat is amazing and it has the moves to back that up! BRAVE BIRD is the strongest stab move with a wide checking rate! RETURN hits most of the entire game for neutral damage, while SUPERPOWER helps killing the problematic rock types! ROOST and BULK UP are also good moves that works well with SUBSTITUTE. ⏺️Weather functional pkmns will have a💧❄️🔥 mark to the right side of the name. ⏺️Swipe right ⏩ to see stats, detailed ev distribution, and sets for the same pkmn. and the pre Evo room!
