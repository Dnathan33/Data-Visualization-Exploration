I thought this photo was quite interesting. I took this picture when I was in New York City a couple months ago while visiting my friend and artist @lenstheartist . To me the photo is meaningful. It is also quite emotional. You know if you look at photo well for me it's a little different. I look at a piece of artwork and feel sometimes what the artist was feeling I'm selves while they we're painting this. This artist may have just done it for the fun of it, but to me it has a meaning for what it is and the location it was painted.  #everythinghasaplace #everythinghasapurpose #itsthereforareason #NYC #newyork #SOHO #art #urban #urbanart #urbanphotography #urbanshooting #senseofstyle #ðŸ“¸ #nikond750
