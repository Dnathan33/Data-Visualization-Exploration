Seeing this breaks my heart. Keith you were truly special. One of the most genuine people I've met. Always busting your ass at LIV but no matter what, finding the time to party with everyone and make em smile. The quotes are perfect about you. No matter what was going on, you saw @audigyofficial and I and it was immediate love giving us big hugs. It was always " I got you", "God bless" and "cmon baby" (with that side look). Gonna miss you brotha. Truly am.  @livmiami will never be the same without you. Till we meet again. #igotyou
