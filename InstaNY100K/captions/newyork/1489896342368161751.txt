Motoharu Sano (pictured right) is one of Japan's most famous rock stars. Known for standing for justice, he also lived in NYC in 1984 and released the first rap album in Japan called "Visitors." He has been preparing a new album about freedom of expression that is a blend of beat poetry, with a fusion rock, jazz and rap. He will launch that in Japan on April 5th and then come to NYC to experiment collaborate and perform at NOT YET FREE. . . . . . . .  #motoharusano #japan #1Future #NOTYETFREE #April2017 #NYC #art #media #projection #NYF #learncreateshareact #learn #create #share #act #SA #Johannesburg #NYC #NY #NewYork #music #socialchange #socialjustice
