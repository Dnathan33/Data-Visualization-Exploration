What a great way to star my Monday... Jean Georges. 😍🌟🌟🌟🍴 This restaurante is one of the few Forbes Five-Star & AAA Five-Diamond restaurants to also be awarded The New York Times top rating and also is one of the city's finest dining destinations. Besides that, This 5 star Michelin rated features a superbly crafted menu, blending French, American and Indochinese ingredients, and the visually stunning floor-to-ceiling windows and the impressive tableside preparations add to the appeal, promising a singular experience. It's the crown-jewel restaurant of a crown-jewel Trump hotel reigning supreme over the Central Park dining scene. 🌟🌟🌟 #trumphotel #restaurant #jeangeorges #michelin #starred #michelinstar #food #amazing #myself #nyc #newyork #centralpark #chef #chefstar #cousin #cook #michelinstar #jeangeorges
