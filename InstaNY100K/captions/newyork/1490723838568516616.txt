Last week I was helping a client clean-out some drawers in her kitchen & discovered pile upon pile of scrap paper as well as freebie stickers & stationary. It reminded me of one of my favorite #TossItTuesday videos from last year, which I just had to share with you again today (link to watch is in my bio). Remember: don’t hold onto those freebies you get in the mail or in those fun, swag bags. If you won’t use the stationary, stickers, & notebooks, donate them, recycle them, or give them to some little ones for arts & crafts. Clear out that clutter & make some space for the things you do use! #JPtips (P.S. - New #TossItTuesday video coming next week!)
