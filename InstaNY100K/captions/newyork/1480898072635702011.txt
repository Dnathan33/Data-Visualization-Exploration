I have no words. Just this: ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. "The Play That Goes Wrong" won the Best New Comedy at the 2015 Laurence Olivier Awards and is now playing on Broadway, featuring the original London cast, and  with J.J. Abrams making his debut as a theatrical producer. Oh, and did I mention that Sir Paul Mccartney was just 4 rows in front of us?! ðŸ˜€@playgoeswrong @bwaygoeswrong @jjabramsofficial #playthatgoeswrong #broadway #play #hilarious #lol #laughoutloud #jjabrams #theater #stage #cast #curtaincall #playbill #nyc #newyorkcity #newyork #manhattan #instagramnyc #instanyc #newyork_ig #newyork_instagram #playgoeswrong #bwaygoeswrong #paulmccartney #beatles #starsighting #nknyðŸŽ­
