This artist named #crash is a #newyorkgraffiti #legend. He started as young as 13 doing trains and is still relevant and visible today at age 55. He has even painted guitars for #ericclapton and #edsheeran. I think this piece was just outside #littleitaly and the #eastvillage in #newYork. #yosemitesam #inittospinit #graf #bomb #tag #scrapyard #johnmatos #keithharing #graffiti #mural #streetart
