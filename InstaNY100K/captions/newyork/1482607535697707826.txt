Today's grub ! This is when I say there are no excuses to clean eating. I snoozed about 6 times this morning. I officially got up 15 minutes before my morning shower time (yes, I plan my morning out - wake up at 5 , prep food and make coffee, & shower by 6) well today I woke up at 545 ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜¡. I was able to prep my snacks, lunch and breakfast all within 15 minutes. Always keep your fridge with a lot of grab and go foods , so eating out isn't a temptation. . . . Breakfast : egg muffin with some black berries, lunch : plain salad with 2 oz of tuna , 1 table spoon of mayo and lemon. Snacks : carrots with hummus and some apple slices. Liquids are 48 oz of water with lemon and diet Snapple that's only 5 calories and 1 gram of carbs (for my sweet tooth right after lunch). . . #jujuxfit#julianasweightlossjourney#nyc#newyorkcity#newyork#fitnessjourney#fitness#weightloss#health#healthy#fitbit#fitbitflex2#vsg#vsgsurgery#vsgjourney#vsg#vsgcommunity#gastricsleeve#gastricsleevesurgery#gastricsleevecommunity#julianasfooddiary#foodlog#foodlover
