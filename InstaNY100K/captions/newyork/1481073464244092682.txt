In The Flow.  5 Rhythms is a dynamic movement practice-the act of bein in your body-that ignites creativity, connection and community. While a seemingly simple dance initiated by Gabriela Roth, it facilitates deep explorations moving the dancer beyond self imposed limitations and isolation into new depths of creativity and connection.  Each rhythm is interpreted by individuals in a uniquely personal way opening them to a new sense of freedom. The 5 Rhythms are Flowing Staccato Chaos Lyrical and Stillness which are just the States of Being. They are a map to everywhere we want to go, on all planes of consciousness-inner and outer, forward and back, physical , emotional and intellectual.  Akara is a dance therapist and a teacher of 5 rhythms who wants to expand her consciousness and work on what she calls the '7 rhythms' soon.
