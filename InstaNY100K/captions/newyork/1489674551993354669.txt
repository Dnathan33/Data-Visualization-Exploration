"Rockaway Beach Birds" nothing too special about them, but it was my first time at the beach in #newyork . In fact, it was my third time in #nyc and I had just discovered that I could take the #subway to the #beach. Here in Argentina the closest similar beach is hundreds of miles away from the city #myphoto #summer #nature #ocean #atlantic #newyorkcity #queens #rockawaybeach #brooklyn #urbanexploration #travel #discover #adventure #trip #canon #70d #photography #picoftheday
