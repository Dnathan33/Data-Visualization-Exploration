A little more love for you NYC & also you LES ðŸŒ† // When @jamiskis and I moved here 2 years ago we didn't have jobs, we didn't have friends, we didn't have a clue about NYC neighborhoods or the housing market. After hopping around from sublet to sublet for 6 months we finally landed in the luckiest spot - this fucking gorgeous corner in the Lower East Side right on the edge of Chinatown ðŸ’«// This perch in the warmer months offers the most magical city experience - people watching galore, a cool breeze off the East River (as it gets hotter that will carry a scent of hot trash but who cares I guess?), sights and sounds of Seward Park, the busy building of the new city on the horizon // There are a lot of things I could say here about hyperlocality, diversity, "gentrification" and more but I'll just leave you with this: it's important to take the time to breathe and fully appreciate the beautiful moments in life. Stopping to smell the roses (or that LES breeze) is key to living a sustainable lifestyle for it quiets the mind, calms the body, and nourishes the soul âœ¨
