I used to hate Rochester. I came here from Boston to study and didn't get a chance to visit the school before coming here. BUT! I discovered some hidden gems and some special people during my last year here. It's still not my favorite city but I appreciate it a lot more than I used to. Yesterday we had perfect weather so we drove up to Lake Ontario. Reminded me of home. #lakeontario #rochester #newyork #boston #massachusetts #travel #citygirl
