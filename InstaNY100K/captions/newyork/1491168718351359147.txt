I came across this picture on my laptop and thought "Wait.I took this picture with my bloody Blackberry in 2011. " New York - Looking over Central Park.  I lived in the U.S for almost a year. Not easy being away from home at such a young age but the memories are priceless. I promised myself that I would go back one day and I will.  Will just be sharing some of the pics I found over the next few days because this was before social media was a thing. I'm making up for it ðŸ˜œ I did some editing nyana.  #NewYork #ConcreteJungle #CentralPark #traveling #buildings #Memories
