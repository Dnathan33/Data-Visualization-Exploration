@thefamelessreport ・・・ Restaurant Review Anchor Heights @anchorheights 575 W 207th St, New York, NY 10034  Time of day: 8:30PM Saturday  I had the pleasure of dining at Anchor Heights in New York and it was a laid back, sexy, date night kind of place. ------------------------------------------------------ 👀 First thing I noticed as I walked through the door was the fixtures and exposed brick. The design of the place reminds me of an old school bar. The dim lighting​ makes it a perfect place to have a whisper conversation. You know, the convos which require being close ------------------------------------------------------ 📝 The waitress was very attentive and polite. She made sure and me and my guests had everything we needed and didn’t get mad when I pronounced some of the food wrong. Or some of the drinks for that matter. 😁 ------------------------------------------------------ Read more at THEFAMELESSREPORT.COM ------------------------------------------------------
