There was simply no peace to be had no matter where you hid yourself away. Even in a northern border town of such intensely chaotic oddity and corruption there was still some greater chaos, some deeper insanity, than one had counted on, or could ever be taken into account - wherever there was anything, there would be chaos and insanity to such a degree that one could never come to terms with it, and it was only a matter of time before your world, whatever you thought it to be, was undermined, if not completely overrun, by another world. ***** @renatagubaeva @musemodelsnyc #nyc #ny #newyork #soho #studio #beauty #portrait #editorial #film #print #vision #icon #curate #patrickxiong #renata #renatagubaeva #muse #ukraine #ukrainian
