2. I first met @marygwendolyn  at her cousin's wedding several years ago. She was a member of the bridal party, and just oh, so cute. I remember how excited she was; how sweet and kind she was; how she bustled around the hotel room that morning for @shoelesspeanut  like it was just the best day ever (I mean, it was, but that's beside the point ðŸ˜‰). I photographed this sweet girl's wedding last year, and it was such a dear day in the way that going to carnivals and the beach is good for the soul. That kind of dear. That kind of special. Mary made her own bouquet out of felt. She also made her invitation suite, and her centerpieces, and her other wedding decor. She's basically a rockstar. Maybe Mary's flowers aren't *real* flowers, but they sure were one of my favorites last year. ðŸ’•
