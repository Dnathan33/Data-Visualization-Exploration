"No mercy will be shown to those who show no mercy, & no forgiveness will be given to those who do not forgive." - (Bukhari) 💁🏼‍♂️insha Allah always try to assume the best of your brother & make excuses for them.  May As-Salam put peace & tranquility in the hearts of all the Muslims & all those who read this. May Al-Qiyuum always allow us to depend on Him when it comes to resolving our problems. Ameen👏🏼 🔹DOUBLE TAP IF YOU AGREE🔹
