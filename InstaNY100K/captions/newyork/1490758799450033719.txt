For Cool Tool Tuesday, I have laid out four tools in a hieroglyphic mini flatlay... these are antique and vintage 'race' knives, also known as timber or lumber scribes, used for placing ownership marks on logs, and registration or other identifying marks on cut lumber.  Dan @thedancherry made an Instagram post on February 28 that provides excellent detailed information on race knives, and I can't do better, so please go take a look at Dan's post.  Three of these are fixed blade 'primitive' tools, in that they are shop made rather than manufactured.  The fourth is a beautiful folding pocket version with rosewood scales, marked on one side of the blade 'New York Knife Co. Walden' and on the other side 'Hammer Brand' with a logo of an arm wielding a hammer.  The New York Knife Company, founded in 1856, was located in Walden, New York until it closed in 1932.  It introduced the Hammer Brand in 1878, and continued to use it right up until its closing.  The Imperial Knife Company, of Providence, Rhode Island, acquired the brand shortly thereafter, and produced Hammer Brand knives for ma'a to years.  The 'Official Price Guide to Collector Knives' rates the Walden-produced Hammer Brand pocket knives a three star (out of four) collectible, whereas the Providence- produced blades get only a single star.  For those that care about such things, the background is the underside of the base of the top tray from a vintage Kennedy mechanic's tool chest.  #cooltooltuesday #flatlay #miniflatlay #layout #hieroglyphics #knife #raceknife #scribe #lumber #log #tools #handtools #oldtools #collectibles #primitive #shopmade #newyorkknifeco #walden #newyork #hammerbrand #hammerbrandknives #imperialknife #providence #rhodeisland #kennedy #toolchest #mechanics
