My job is currently having some floor work done. It's a shame we can't keep the hard wood floors instead of installing tile, but overall it's best for the type of work we do. It's been this way for close to a month and I can't wait for it to finish. Then we can get back to normal business and stop disappointing our clients. #wood #working #workingfortheweekend #hardwoodfloors #construction #remodeling #bedonealready #newyork #blue #smallbusiness
