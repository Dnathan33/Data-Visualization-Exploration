Photo 2 of 3 :: These guys  @badponymusic are from Sydney, Australia and have been in LA since Friday. They are down to earth and loads of fun. Their music is intriguing and their lyrics and sound are catchy. We chatted a bit with a couple of them post show and then parted ways and headed over to Father's Office for a pint and a burger. While we were chilling there the fellows rolled up and sat down next to us. Jolly good fun. Conversation ensued and laughter and goodtimes. They remind us a bit of another band with the initials BP (Blind Pilot) crossed with a bit of Freelance Whales. They are wonderful. If you were lucky üçÄ enough you had a chance to hear them last night at @themintla and, quite possibly after, you went to a local pub and they happened to make their way over and take a seat by you; and while chatting you may have decided to let your guard down. If that was you, cheers! Bon voyage boys. Have fun in NYC!!! . . . . #badpony #musicians #musicianslife #losangeles #livemusic #platform #fathersoffice #nyc #sydney #australia #photography #jasonsorgephotography #california #newyork #goodtimes @sofarsounds @sofarsoundsla
