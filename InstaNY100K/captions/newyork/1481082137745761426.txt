Jay-Z, Heavy D and Lil’ Kim, photographed at the opening of Puff Daddy’s soul food restaurant "Justin’s" in New York City on September 30, 1997.  Other guests at the grand opening celebration included Mariah Carey, Michael Rappaport, Mike Tyson, Tommy Tune, Andre Harrell, Clive Davis, and the snake in the grass himself—Donald Trump. Named after his first-born son Justin Combs, Puff followed it up with an Atlanta location in 1998. The NYC restaurant was closed in 2007 after 10 years in business due to the need for a larger building; but a new location was never opened. The Atlanta restaurant would be shut down in 2012. #jayz #heavyd @lilkimthequeenbee #1997 @diddy @princejdc #newyork #hiphop #rap
