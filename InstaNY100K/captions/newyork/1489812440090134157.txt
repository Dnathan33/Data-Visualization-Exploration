Lebanese couturier Elie Saab has opened the first store in the United States in New York and plans to unveil an additional bridal store in the Big Apple in late 2017. Situated at the corner of Madison Ave and 70th Street at 860 Madison Ave, the new flagship occupies 2,400 square feet spread across two floors and is complete with a stainless steel wall, a spiral marble staircase, and floor-to-ceiling windows. Designed in collaboration with architectural design agency RDAI, the boutique also features a private salon and dressing rooms, an intuitive move for the brandâ€™s clientele. #ElieSaab #NewYork #thelocationgroup #shopopening #storeopening #elocations
