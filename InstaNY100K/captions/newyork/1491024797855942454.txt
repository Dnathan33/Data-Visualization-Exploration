Fun fact... I didn't have a sweet tooth until @design.this got me a stand mixer one year for my birthday ... now I'm that person who comes home after a longgggg day and decides to bake as a way to relax ðŸ˜­ wow! Never thought I'd see the day.... on another note, my piping skills are getting better ðŸ˜Ž #practicemakesperfect #NewbieBaker #cupcakes #baking #sweets #sweettooth #cake #youtuber #homecook #homechef #newyork #chef #foodie #foodgasm #foodporn #foodiegram
