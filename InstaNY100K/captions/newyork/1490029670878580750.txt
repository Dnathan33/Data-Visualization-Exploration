We're not gonna lie, we're never not chasing the sun. And perfect NYC days like these call for "outdoor" activities like catching the new Biennial exhibit at the Whitney Museum and catching epic views of the city with a few of your favorite ladies. We can't help but see everything through rose-colored glasses during times like these. 😍 #artcrawl #spring #nyc 📷@daniellerobles
