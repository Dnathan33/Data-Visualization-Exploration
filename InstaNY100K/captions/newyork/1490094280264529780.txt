The colors I picked up yesterday from @shopvioletvoss. They were on sale 5 for $30. I couldn't pass it up... at first @lipdrama and I were going to split it but then we both wanted 5.. 😂😂❤. I can't wait to swatch these for you guys. They are GORGEOUSSSSS. Need to find some poppin glitter glue first. Any suggestions? Had to pick up a holographic one - champagne bubbly.
