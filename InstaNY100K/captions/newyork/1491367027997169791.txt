💥Rant of the Day💥  There is such a lack of support for each other 🙁 It's so sad. Why can't we be supportive of people's dreams, jobs, aspirations, goals, schooling, training ect.  Training for a fitness competition, which my fellow fitness competitors know, it's one of the hardest things you can commit too. You don't understand how much food and drink revolves around everything we do. Training is so hard, takes lots of self control (in the kitchen) and is so time consuming. Why cant we all respect each other and be supportive.  That's what the world needs, to be happy, to be caring, to be loving, to show respect, to show kindness and spread goodness 💜  I'm always happy for everyone's accomplishments. You got a new car, congrats, you got a new job, congrats, you got a new home, congrats. I am always truly happy for others achievements.
