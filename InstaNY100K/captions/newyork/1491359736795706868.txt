"My job let's me play a variety of different characters w/ a variety of different stories from different walks of life. Sometimes it's really sad and complicated and sometimes it's really joyful and effortless. Either way, I love telling their stories. I become fully immersed in it. I just want to be truthful when I do it so that I don't disrespect the character I'm playing or the writer who wrote it." ~Lee Coc  #ActorsLife ðŸŽ­ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ¥ðŸ“º
