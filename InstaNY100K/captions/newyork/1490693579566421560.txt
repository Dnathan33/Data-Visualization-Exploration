A Life, just like a painting, is created with marks that form our experiences; they are layered, parts of a whole, and become our story. Those very first marks are truly exciting. They are filled with expectations and hope! Most of the work is this balance of energy, a give and take that happens... you decide what works and what does not; what will make it to the final cut. But always, there are lessons, and love in the process if we're lucky. ...This story has been 3-years in the making, and I have learned that sometimes, we are not always in control of what happens, but now, at least, strength and hope remain, and I am looking forward to the future... in paint and in #mylife and I know good things will come! 🙏☮️ #grateful #hudsonvalley #newyork #artist #faithgoldsteinfineart
