Considering how I felt yesterday I can hardly believe how great today has been 🤗 so much LOVE ✨ I spent an hour or two last night going through all the comments and messages. It's all beautiful, like a rainbow of words 🌈 but one comment in particular just clicked for me, and I've been feeling powerful since... @infinitecrowlove 🙌🏽 'To the question of when we feel lonely but want to be alone ~ this is when our souls are asking for our own self love, each painful feeling that arises is asking to be delved into and held like a child. We must tend to these pains as we care for a child, with all of our presence and awareness. We can't just tell the pains to shut up anymore and numb them as many of our parents unknowingly did to our deepest pains and emotions, causing us to not be able to deal with ourselves compassionately. You are truly healing as you confront each demon in yourself, you confront them for ALL as we are truly one interconnected being. Feel empowered in the knowing that you are taking responsibility for yourself as a micro in the macro. To speak your vulnerability is what's needed in this reality, thank you - @infinitecrowlove 🦋  no, no, thank you ☺️ yesterday I was completely lost, today I feel as though I'm found, but I know my emotions are running riot now. One day at a time, each day as it comes - For today I'm grateful, today was lovely 🌈 thank you all. Thank you all... ❤️❤️❤️ #Day8sober
