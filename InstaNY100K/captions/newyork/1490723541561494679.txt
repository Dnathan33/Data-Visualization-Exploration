Today 6th Ave runs all the way down to Tribeca where it merges with and into Church street, but originally it used to terminate at Carmine street. In 1925 they began extending 6th and swallowed many houses on many streets, as well as obliterating two streets almost entirely - Congress street and Hancock street, though remains of both still kind of exist today. Hancock exists as a small triangle on 6th at Bleecker street, and Congress is now a turning lane onto West Houston in front of the fire station, which is often blocked somewhat by fire trucks and/or cars. One block further south Macdougal street used to terminate at Spring street, but the 6th avenue extension left a small triangular plot of land so they terminated Macdougal at Prince street and made this a park. Today itâ€™s known as Father Fagan Park. #soho #sohonyc #fatherfaganpark #southvillage #manhattan #park #nypix #newyork #newyorkcity #nyc
