Time to destroy this back come July ğŸ˜ˆ (This picture was taken the day after my last show)... Your always in a constant battle between yourself in bodybuilding mentally and physically. To look and be the best version of you, you have to constantly remind yourself to push through the tough times and be humble when your at the top don't let your scenario dictate your future. PUSH YOURSELF TO THE LIMIT!!! _____________________________________________  Also super exited to be with @1upnutrition throughout my whole prep to always crush my daily workouts and goals ğŸ’ªğŸ”¥ğŸ’ªğŸ”¥ğŸ’ª #teamuniverse
