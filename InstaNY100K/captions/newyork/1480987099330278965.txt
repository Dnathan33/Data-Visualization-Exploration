New York. New York. The city that stole my heart. As a Bombay girl, it was very easy for me to fall in love with New York. Fast, intense, spirited. Reclaimed from islands. The city has an indescribable spirit. The same can be said for New Yorkers. At the end of the day, it's the people that make the city. Oh, and the skyline!  #newyork #iloveny #brooklynbridge #thecityofdeams #travelgram #girlswhotravel #gwt #thisgirltravels #thisgirl #instany #darlingescapes #sheisnotlost #wearetravelgirls #everydayny #goseetheworld
