Look at this cheeky treehouse set deep in the heart of the East Village. So far east in fact is this part of the East Village that the male guerrilla forbids me from going there solo lest bandits and roving wild beasts spirit me off to places unknown (most likely Queens). Anyway. As I'm here now, want me to creep in further to get a better view and do some proper recon!? 🕵🏻‍♀️
