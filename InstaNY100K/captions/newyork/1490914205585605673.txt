It's been forever since I've been fishing. Some of my happiest memories are of when I was 12 and used to spend my summers at my grandmothers lake house in South Georgia. With bamboo fishing poles, I would sit there for hours until the sun set over Lake Blackshear. Big thanks to @h_forbes_h for those couple casts and for being a part of this project. ðŸ“¸: @rileyjwils
