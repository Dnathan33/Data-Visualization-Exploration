Great job New York! Now let's build in the necessary supports to ensure that our students meet the criteria. And as always people, do your research and remember to always read the fine print: ğŸ‘“Must be enrolled full-time and average 30 credits per year to get funding. ğŸ‘“Must maintain a passing grade point average. ğŸ‘“Must also stay in-state after college for the same number of years that they got free tuition. *Otherwise, their scholarship would be converted into loans. ğŸ‘“Room and board expenses would not be covered by the Excelsior Scholarship.
