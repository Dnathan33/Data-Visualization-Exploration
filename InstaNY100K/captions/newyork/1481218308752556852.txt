While there are ways to avoid acne, sometimes there's no help for a single pimple that shows up at the worst time. Whether it be stress, hormones, or poor diet, you don't have to let your unfortunate zit make its home on your face. Try using a combination of dermatologist solutions and home remedies to remove your pimple in a jiffy. .  Make a cucumber mask. This solution works best for soothing your skin and reducing redness, but is not as effective as aforementioned solutions for killing bacteria. Mince a bit of cucumber to form a paste, and put this directly on your pimple or over your whole face. Wait for it to set for 15-20 minutes, and then rinse your skin off with cold water. Voila! Your redness should be significantly reduced, and youâ€™ll feel cool as a cucumber. . Ice your pimple. Similar to aspirin, ice is often used to bring down swelling and redness on the body. Hold an ice cube or an ice pack over your pimple for 20-30 minutes. This will cause the pore to close up, which then causes the excess bacteria and dirt to drain out on its own. Furthermore, it will lose its redness and size, giving your skin a nearly normal texture and appearance. This method may also help if the pimple is causing you pain." ) #newyork #miami #wynwood #foodporn #healthyeating #southbeach
