After five hours on the road, I arrived at West Point at midnight, so ready to jump into a comfortable bed. My keys were waiting as I was the last guest to arrive, and as I went up to my room, the epic space nerd in me was so surprised and excited. It turns out they gave me the legendary Buzz Aldren's room to stay in! (He was on NASA's first successful trip to the moon accompanied by Neil Armstrong). I took in all the historic memorabilia in the room, including the guestbook on the table with Buzz's name engraved into it. As I flipped through the pages, I noticed that the man himself left a note every time he stayed in the room! I've added one of his entries into this slide show, and traced my fingers over the words so I can brush up against greatness :). As I got into bed, the thought also crossed my mind that I've spent the night in the same bed as a lunar legend and space walker...which is equal parts awkward and awesome- but it's all good as I slept dreaming of the stars last night #hero #lunarlanding ðŸš€ðŸŒ—ðŸ’« ____________________________________________ #space #hero #nasa #ny #igny #westpoint #military #america #thatsdarling #wanderlust #adventure #kinfolk #igers #igdc #acreativedc #newyork #hudson #architecture #design #interiordesign #history #hero #inspiration #legend #galaxy #moon @nasa #travel #worldtraveler #instagood
