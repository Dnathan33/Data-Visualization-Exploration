I feel this team did an amazing job this season. We were the leading team with the most wins on the road. Despite the downfall we had for our home games, each and everyone contributed to the journey to the playoffs and they really tried their best to play. And I never lost faith in this team. I love them so dearly. Now tomorrow is the start of the playoffs, let's get it boys. LET'S GO RANGERS ❤💙🎉 #nyr #nyrangers #newyorkrangers #blueshirt #blueshirts #blueshirtsunited #blueshirtsnation #blueshirtsproud #rangerstown #nyr90 #ny #newyorkcity #newyork #nyc #manhattan #msg #madisonsquaregarden #nhl #nationalhockeyleague #stanleycup #stanleycupplayoffs #nyrplayoffs #playoffs #webleedblue
