That time I had a talk with founder's of Bond Street (@onbondstreet), Peyton and David. . .  @dhaber: "Bond Street is transforming small business lending through technology, data and design. The company was founded on the belief that small business owners are the foundation for growth in our economy, and yet today’s banking system has left them behind. Bond Street provides one to three year term loans from $50,000 to $500,000 range with rates starting at 6%." . . Q: Is there anything that surprised you about being an entrepreneur?  A: The thing that I’ve enjoyed most about being an entrepreneur (and certainly the accomplishment that I am most proud of) has been building our team. At the end of the day, a business is only as good as the people that comprise it, so it is incredibly important to be deliberate about who you hire and ensure that they are exceptional. I’ve also seen first hand, how building a very strong core group of employees builds on itself and pays huge dividends over time. . .  Q: Was your spouse/parents/friends supportive you when you told them you were going to be an entrepreneur?  A: My wife have always been incredibly supportive of my interest in building Bond Street. If anything, she was pushing me to start the company even before I knew I was ready myself. She realized that I would never truly be happy / fulfilled unless I tried. It’s definitely been the most challenging (and rewarding) business experience that I’ve had, and only possible given the patience and support that she’s shown over the past few years.
