True Peace and Serenity ðŸŒžðŸ’« I've always felt the need to be different and to stand out, even when I would get teased for it growing up. I was never the cool or popular person in my class. Growing up I was often bullied for always sticking to my truth and being myself. Now looking back, all of those hard moments have made me so strong and has built the foundation for the person that I am today. Without going through the experience of people telling me I was wrong for being myself, I truly believe I wouldn't be here today with my mindset and my goals. I am extremely grateful for my path and every experience is a new learning opportunity for myself. #effortlyss #miami
