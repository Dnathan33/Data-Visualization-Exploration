Me and #arminthecat are preparing Easter celebrations a la Swedish påskris style.  I am currently in a yoga cleansing course with Amanbir at Golden Bridge. Therefor I est strictly vegan right now, No coffe, No bread, no sugar or salt, not even nuts so my mood isn't the best throughout the day. This is day two. I am happy I managed to stay on the horseback after the morning kriya today because I wasn't a very nice or bright person without a proper meal in between riding and yoga. I have successfully eaten a good lunch just now though consisting of steamed veggies and black rice. And I chooses my t-shirt carefully after the current mood- "have you hugged me today", which I bought a year ago from the wonderful Nepalese people in the Himalayas who hand made the print. 🍏🍎🍐🍌🍋🍋🍋🍋👻 #vegan #cleanse #detox #yoga #yogalife #yogini #easter #nyc #newyork #nycyoga #kundaliniyoga
