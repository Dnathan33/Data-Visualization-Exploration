Three years ago on a very cold afternoon in #centralpark I #married this lovely chap and had a brilliant time in #newyork to boot ❤👰 He's the kindest, most supportive person I know, who wanted me to quit teaching (which I eventually did) because he could see how ill it was making me, and made me start #running again when injury ended my #hockey days. He doesn't think I #run too much, and he's never surprised when I finish a race because he believes in me more than I ever do. I'm quite fond of Mr T really 😀💕 ************************************************** Edit: the trusty Facebook memories has reminded me that Best Man extraordinaire @robscutchings and I went for a lovely run around Central Park the morning of the wedding. I know I had a lovely time but now I wonder if it was to make sure I didnt run away?! Cracking speech too Rob, I still get the giggles when I think of it x . . . #wedding #weddinganniversary #nycwedding #newyorkwedding #centralparkwedding #runningsupporter #mybiggestfan
