Monday's Motivation... Sometimes you have to fall back to get a better view 🤔 Woke up this morning feeling like I need to go a little harder. Often the place we are used to is not the place where we belong 💯 What if you found out the only thing that stands between you and your dreams is you? 😕 Personally, I am still learning, I've neglected how far I've come focused on where I want to be.  This harsh reality can be the prelude to an awesome realization... I am thankful for the process. 🙏 #godbless #allyouneedisyou  #holdyourown #holdmyown #barcodefitness #salute  #livelovelife #barcodefitness #perspective #loner #rest #support  #cardio #chest #bodyweight #exercise  #fitness  #motivation #muscle #progress #training #nike  #trainhard  #noweights #workouts #calisthenics #newyork #activewear
