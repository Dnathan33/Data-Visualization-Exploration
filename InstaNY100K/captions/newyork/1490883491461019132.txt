ðŸš¨PLAYOFFS TEASERðŸ’¥ONE WAR, TWO FRIENDS, ONLY ONE CAN SURVIVEðŸš¨ . Alain Vigneault. Touting his teamâ€™s speed, balance and experience, Alain Vigneault said Tuesday he believes his Rangers have just as good a chance of hoisting the Stanley Cup as any team in the playoffs. . Vigneault said he knows it will be a tough series, but he believes this yearâ€™s Rangers are a different squad than the one that was eliminated by the eventual champion Penguins in five games in the 2016 first round.(-CBSNew-York) . Claude Julien. This is a man who has been through a lot this season, starting with the World Cup of Hockey, where he was an assistant coach for the championship team, followed by his firing by the Bruins after 10 seasons in Boston on Feb. 7 and his hiring by the Canadiens only a week later to replace Michel Therrien. . Julien looks like heâ€™s having fun coaching the Canadiens for the second time and his players have definitely responded to him. The team has a 15-5-1 record since Julien took over from Therrien and is peaking at the perfect time with five straight wins and only one regulation-time loss in the last nine games (7-1-1).
