This weekend was obviously one of extreme highs and lows (pretty much entirely on #friday, apparently), but playing the @beastmodulus #Being #album #release #show with @godmakerbk was definitely a huge fucking #high.  thanks to @sbryantd for the official best shot of the night, thanks to @gutterbar #bk, and all of you who came out.  even if i was running on fumes, i NEEDED that show!  #Godmaker #Brooklyn #NY #BecauseLoud.  #Blurry #beard #farmers... #riff #therapy.  #grateful #sick (literally) #drummer.  #nyc #doom #sludge #stoner #whatever #metal. #newyork #livemusic #drums #happiness.
