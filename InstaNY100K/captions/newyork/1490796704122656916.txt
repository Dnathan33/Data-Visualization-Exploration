Went on an adventure to Hoboken to have lunch with a college friend I haven't seen in seven years! The views from Hoboken looking over the Hudson River to see the NYC skyline was breathtaking. 80 degree weather helps too! Hoboken seemed full of life, active and thriving. There were so many neat boutiques and restaurants along Washington. I'll definitely be back🙌🏽
