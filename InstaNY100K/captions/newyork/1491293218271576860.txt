Good morning! Have you ever stood in the place of someone else that you did not want to receive punishment ? Jesus did this for us. He is the only one that could have done it . He became the perfect sacrifice for us . We are forever indebted to him . It is with tears that I worship and praise Him because He was beaten instead of me. He faced death for me. He won the victory for all mankind and the relationship between God and man was mended. This is why I love Jesus and live for Him. Have a wonderful day! #god #jesus #bible #homeless #christianity #christians #pray #lord #christ #salvation #praise #worship #motivationalquotes #saved #jesuschrist #london #newyork #holyspirit #jehova #bless #memes #sunday #somebody #churchmemes #memehistory #life #love #my #yes #blessed
