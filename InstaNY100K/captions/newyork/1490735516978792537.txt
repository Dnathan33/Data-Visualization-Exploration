It's #TipTuesday! Think about how many times you have told yourself, "I will be happy when..." So many people will spend their lives telling themselves this lie. That thing that you think will make you happy won't. Happiness is in the present moment. Happiness is in the memories you create with your family and friends. Happiness is every moment you take to work towards bettering yourself. Take time out for yourself. Get the clarity you need.
