After walking for hours in the streets of NY I stumbled across @faydabakery an Asian bakery on 6th Ave, my sister who had lived  in Shanghai recommended that I should order the Japanese cheesecake ( popular all over Asia & Instagram ) & an Almond Bubble tea ( Milky Almond tea with tapioca balls) the cheesecake consistency is like nothing I have ever tried before! I would describe it just like a cloud in my mouth ☁️💕 delicious 🤤 #japanesecheesecake
