guys let's do something  do something today that's for you, like take a bath or eat some ice cream, work out if u don't work out, do ur homework if you normally don't usually do it or !! Something like that!! And try to do that like once a day, just because it's good 4 u  and then come back in like a month and tell me if it made any sort of significant difference in your stress levels or grades or anything.  just 4 fun  I'm gonna try to work out again bc I always fall through with a routine but like I really need to relieve stress and it's just a good habit to get in 2 but like yeah  anyways good morning
