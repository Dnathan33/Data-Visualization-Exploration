"Attending SVA has allowed me to explore who I am as an artist. The range of studio classes and the various backgrounds of all the instructors lets you know there isn’t one set way to create art. There’s a positive and constructive competition between your peers that allows you to refine your voice through your work." - Zakiya Noel (@zakiyadraws ) #svanyc #sva #schoolofvisualarts #artschool #artist #instart #digitalart
