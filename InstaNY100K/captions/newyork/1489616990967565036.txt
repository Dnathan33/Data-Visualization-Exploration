Best friends for 14 years and many more to come. Know we didn't get to hang as much this trip with life being busy for both of us and major changes On the horizon especially for you with your little baby girl on the way and about to be born. Through it all though we've managed to keep in touch and keep it real. We ride together we die together bad boys for life. Love you bro. Until next time. #bestfriend #mehloramigo #badboysforlife #newyork #newyorkcity #nyc
