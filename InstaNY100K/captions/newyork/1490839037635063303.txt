Quick #PSA for #Easter - please don't buy chicks without intentions of raising them! These animals are not Easter presents! If you, or someone you know, did purchase chicks for kids or grandkids, and cannot raise them, bring them to someone who can. If you're near #columbiacounty we will take them in. They cannot live wild in NY!  #chicken #tractorsupply #babychicks #babychicken #spring #springpictures #hudsonvalley #hudsonvalleyphotographer #newyork #cuteanimals #explorehudsonvalley #protectanimals #beresponsible #chickenlife #hudson #hudsonriver #greenecounty #catskills #dutchesscounty #rhinebeck #redhook #ulstercounty #rockefellerranch
