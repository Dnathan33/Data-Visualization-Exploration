Tom Is Not A Boy refers to ANDROGYNY in it's purest form, we do not fit into boxes. Being a Tomboy is not about being manly or acting like a boy, we are all made up of masculine and feminine energies & we identify with 1 more than the other. Don't let society place you in a box, continue being true to yourself...which is just a different type of girl. The 'Tom' in Tomboy is Feminine.üòùüî• ---------------------------------------------- Available Now on www.INTIMATEGRIND.com || FB.com/IntimateGRIND.
