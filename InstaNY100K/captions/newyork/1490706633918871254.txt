Between September 2011 and February 2012, Rosetta Watson called the police in Maplewood, Mo., four time to report instances of domestic violence she had sustained at the hands of her former boyfriend in her own home. After her fourth call to the police to report the violence she had survived — and needed police help in protecting herself from — the city of Maplewood not only evicted Watson from her home, but forced her to leave town for six months.  http://buff.ly/2nBeXgz
