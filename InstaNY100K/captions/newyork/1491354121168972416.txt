I walk to the beat of my own drum. I have chosen to walk the path, that most would have strayed from. I am not afraid of being me, even when I was told growing up, that who I am is wrong. Did their words hurt? Yes... Did I cry? Yes... Did I often have thoughts of committing suicide? Yes, unfortunately I did. Eventually, I chose to get involved with #gangbangin , just to hide what I was really feeling inside. I was afraid to be me. Afraid to be myself. I didn't have the confidence, because I didn't receive the love necessary, to build my self esteem and nourish my soul. I lived in an ignorant bliss for too long, & when my father passed away, I finally woke up from my spiritual slumber. I guess that's why I choose to give so much love, and why I have so much in my heart now. You see, once I found out how to finally love myself, I have made it my life's purpose, to try and make sure, that you feel, what I now feel. If you give your children more love, it will make it easier for them to find their purpose. How ironic is that? When my purpose in life, is to give to everyone else, what I wasn't given... #loveiseverything ( photo credit and black cap are provided by none other than @thebeardcompany )
