âœ¨NYC/NJ FRIENDSâœ¨: Interrupting my usual coverage to share an adoption listing for Benny, a two month-old French bulldog. His owner kept him crated for 23 hours a day and when she discovered he has a spinal deformity, she threw him out on the sidewalk in his crate like garbage. You can find Benny's adoption listing at www.MightyMutts.org and give him another chance at the life he deserves ðŸ’—
