You know what I love about film is the fact that every vantage point has a story to be told. And when you go into edit, you can tell the story in a million different ways. Film is just so free. Subjective, but so free. One of the first art forms I did before film was traditional art with multiple mediums. But the contrast between the two art forms are slight. The canvas for film is a different beast yet the same as a paint canvas in many ways  The world is you canvas
