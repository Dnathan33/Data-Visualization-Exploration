Afternoon at Seaport. I miss the old Pier 17 Seaport mall before demolition,  it was a great place to have a drink on the deck, looking at the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges over the Hudson River under the sun. #newyork #manhattan #newyork_Instagram  #lifestyle #cityview #ilovenewyorkcity #nyc #picture_of_newyork #ig_newyorkcity  #serialtraveler #seaport #newyorkcity #building #newyorkcityview #skyscraper
