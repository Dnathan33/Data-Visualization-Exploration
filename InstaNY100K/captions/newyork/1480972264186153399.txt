Stephanie Joanne Angelina Germanotta rose to fame in 2008 as Lady gaga and has since forever changed pop culture.  After back to back successes with her first two albums she took a little break before releasing her third album "Born this way" a record which we love but for reasons we still don't understand didn't garner as much praise from the masses.  Only a few shows into the American portion of the Born this way tour Lady gaga cancelled the remaining tour dates citing the need for hip surgery.  Everyone said gaga was abandoning a sunken ship, and using a fake  injury as a means to escape the criticism toward her BTW era.  Two years later gaga released "Artpop" which further distanced her from being the queen of top 40, but secured her artistry by owning it (do what you want is her best work sans the R Kelly feature). Since Artpop gaga has put out two projects "cheek to cheek" and her latest "Joanne" both of which have acted as great pillars to her incredible career spanning nearly 10 years now.  She just turned 31 years old and we hope she spent it surrounded by the best company imaginable.  Cheers to the incomparable @ladygaga üíê
