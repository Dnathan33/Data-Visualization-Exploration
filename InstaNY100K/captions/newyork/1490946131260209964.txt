We're currently fighting over who gets to take our ONLY copy of Veronica on our subway commutes. Far and away, this is one of our favorite books of all time. It's like diving into an old New York of magical realism and adventure. There's something new to discover every time you read it. Can't recommend it enough âœ¨ðŸ–¤ #NicholasChristopher #bookstagram #book #newyork #magic #art #vanessaives #magicalrealism
