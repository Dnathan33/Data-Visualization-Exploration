It's #NationalPetDay! Don't have a pet? #AdoptACat today! || Meet the adorable, Charleston! He is a sensitive kitty who adores gentle attention. At timesÂ he can be nervous around new people, but as soon as he warms up, he will want to be showered with #LOVE! Charleston loves to nap but also has a playful side!
