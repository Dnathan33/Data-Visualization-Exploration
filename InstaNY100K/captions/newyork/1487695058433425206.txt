Assemblage, 2004 Oil on canvas  By  Michigan, America  now residing in Brooklyn,  New York  Dana Schultz B 1976 - • • • One of Schultz's paintings caused substantial controversy from the general public as well as artists exhibiting alongside her, "Open Casket". "Open Casket" is a painting Schultz executed in 2016 of 'Emmett Till', an African-American 14 year old boy who was lynched by two white men in Mississippi in 1955; it was brutal.  The artwork was one of the paintings included in the Whitney Biennial exhibition in New York this year. The painting caused considerable outrage with protests and calls for the painting's destruction. I have not included it for obvious reasons. • • • #abstract #abstractart #colourful #whitneymuseum #whitneybiennial #figurative #contraversial #people #studio #photo #art #artist #artwork #fineart #gallery #museum #exhibition #opencasket #protest #outrage #newyork
