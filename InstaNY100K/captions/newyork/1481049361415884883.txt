I shit this 30,000 feet over New York.  It was going into darkness as we rode through clouds. An green dark light. What's the difference when you stare at the distance from this height rather than 6 feet. Beautifully naturally abstract. And the darkness is full of light. I did a painting like this 7 years ago titled 'staring across the lake (after Peter Doig). #newyork #ny #searching #dark #light #darkness #abstraction #30,000ft #flying #gee #alone ##colour #green #peterdoig
