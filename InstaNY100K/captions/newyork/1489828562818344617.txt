I was maybe 1 or 2 years out of high school and before one college credit I started an apprenticeship with a great photographer who studied under this legend (Gordan Parks) One of the few photos I captured of him, here with his daughter and chef Leslie Park at the opening of Songs of My People exhibit at the Museum City of New York. A project I was lucky enough to be involved in 25 years ago. #museumcityofnewyork #themuseumcityofnewyork #gordanparks #gordanparksfoundation #90s #newyork #newyorkcity #nyc #blackisbeautiful #blacklivesmatter #photography #photographer #legend #shaft
