"Herrrreee, piggy, piggy..." Get ready to be saying that a lot, because your life's about to change. You're about to meet a 4 year-old dynamo on four legs. A captivating cutie with drool for days and a smile that doesn't quit. A charismatic queen who demands nothing but the best because, quite simply, deserves nothing less! Yes, you're about to meet...Ms. Piggy (#A1107948)! üê∑ I had the distinct pleasure on a recent, spring afternoon. And even though the sun was shining everywhere, birds were chirping, a breeze was blowing, when Ms. Piggy set her two chubby hooves I mean paws down upon the ground it was as if time stood still, the clouds they all parted, and a ray of sunlight burst from the sky and fell down solely on her. Of course with a face like that Piggy's no stranger to attention. As she romped and played in the yard she mesmerized everyone around her. Flinging a stuffed carrot and catching it midair, snorting happily as she demanded I mean waited for treats, and flopping into frog legs with an endless grin, enjoying the grass across her ample belly. Yes, the one reason NOT to come meet Ms. Piggy today? If you're allergic to belly laughs, perfection, utter joy, and complete delight. Otherwise? Ms. Piggy is waiting in adoptions at Manhattan's ACC. üêæ‚ù§üêæ #adoptmspiggy #easyasacc #foster #adopt #rescue #shelterdog #rescuedog #dog #dogs #dogsofig #dogsofnyc #dogofheday #dogsofinstagram #puppy #puppylove #puppiesofinstagram #newyorkcity #newyork #nyc #pit #pitbull #pitbulllove #pitbullsofig #pitbullsofinstagram #adoptdontshop
