“I think what’s most important about any fight is having the right mindset. I know that I am putting in work at the gym, training as hard as I can, and leaving it all on the mats at the end of each day. They could send me anywhere and it won’t matter because of all the work I’ve done leading up to my bout. It is a real honor though, to be able to fight where I grew up. I wasn’t sure if it would ever be able to happen, but as soon as I found out that it was, I waited for the right time. Lots of New York-based fighters would have killed for this opportunity, and I am very grateful that I get to have this chance.” - @gregorthegift Gets to Take the Rumble Home  NOW on NewYorkFighitng.com  Writer: @pariunderthesea Photos: @newyorkfighting  #TheGift - #UFC210 - #NewYorkFighting
