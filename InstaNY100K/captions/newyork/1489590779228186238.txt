I'm so glad that I have such a beautiful , strong and inspirational real friends by my side.  I met Adriana 8 years ago here in US when both of us were Aupairs. And the day that promised to myself to go back and live in NYC she was by my side.  And I just moved to NYC because I knew that Renata was living here and I knew that she will be such a good partner and a friend.  Thank you girls for all that you did for me as a friend I love you from the bottom of my heart !  #love #friendship #gratitude #happiness  #nyc #newyork
