"There's a place I go to Where no one knows me It's not lonely It's a necessary thing It's a place I made up Find out what I'm made of The nights are stayed up Counting stars and fighting sleep  Let it wash over me Ready to lose my feet Take me on to the place where one reviews life's mistery Steady on down the line Lose every sense of time Take it all in and wake up that small part of me Day to day I'm blind to see And find how far To go..." @hilazaf @liorbenchetrit
