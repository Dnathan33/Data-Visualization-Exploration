To all my fellow Entrepreneurial spirited persons out here...remember, its OK to have a job until you get where you want to be. Approach that job as an internship milking everything you can. And treat it like a sponsorship while it pays for your necessities and funds your dream(s). Happy Tuesday! Lets get to it!! LET'S GOOOO!!!!! #Business #Professional #Resumes #CoverLetters #Success #Work #Paterson #NewJersey #NewYork #WeAllNeedALilMotivation #ThePlug #Hunger #Grind #LetsGo #BeGreat #IgotUs #AgrowingLegacy #Jesbusinesswriting
