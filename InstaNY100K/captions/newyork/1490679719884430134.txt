Brighten up your dull, oily skin with a rejuvenating strawberry face mask! ✨🍓Strawberries are not only good for your health but also for your skin. They are rich in vitamin C and antioxidants that offer skin lightening, brightening and anti-aging benefits. This delicious fruit 🍓 is particularly good for oily and acne prone skin as it helps remove excess sebum. It also works as a great skin toner, thanks to its astringent properties. It contains alpha-hydroxy acids that help remove dead skin cells and treat acne. They also promote firm and smooth skin, and help fade acne scars and blemishes. Plus, the antioxidant ellagic acid in strawberries prevents the break down of collagen that contributes to wrinkles. It also protects the skin from damage caused by the sun’s ultraviolet rays✨✨✨ 🍓🍓🍓 #devenirnewyork #indiebeauty #indieskincare#greenbeauty #beautiful #beautyblog #greenblog #organicbeauty #organicblogger#organicskincare#madeinbrooklyn#love#girl#nyc#apothecary#botanicals#alluremagazine#vogue #newyork#cleanbeauty #harpersbazaar#fall#marieclair#naturalskincare#fashion#cleanbeauty#saks
