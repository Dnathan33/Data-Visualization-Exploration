What to do all weekend- Friday go to the Modern for some bourbon ðŸ¥ƒ Saturday go to the Guggenheim for some Picssso & see some of my favorite paintings ever ðŸŽ¨ then go to the MET for tea & cap it off  Sunday with a walk through Central Park. I think the museums are what I'll miss most here. #70Â° #centralpark #newyorkcity #newyork #missing #park #love #picasso #brauner #cezanne #chagall #degas #delaunay #alonetime #manet #monet #motherwell #picasso #renoir #rousseau #seurat #vangough
