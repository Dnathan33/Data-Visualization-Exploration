SPRING IN NYC - At the onset of spring, the Yoshino Cherry trees see a blizzard of delicate and ornate white and pink-tinged flowers. The flowers are followed by small black cherries which are bitter to humans but loved by birds. Spotted on the tree is an American Robin, native to Central Park in New York. Look above and beyond... can there ever be a dull moment?  #spring #cherryblossom #cherryblossomnewyork #yoshino #cherrytree #flowers #americanrobin #birds #centralpark #nyc #newyork #newyorkcity
