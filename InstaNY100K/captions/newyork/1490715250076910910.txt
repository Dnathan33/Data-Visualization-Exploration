"I dont just dance. I perform. I breathe. I watch the world disappear. I release my feelings. I lead with my heart. I tear down my walls. I stop feeling sad. I lose the pain. I let go. I smile. No... I dont just dance, I do so much more!!!" ~Unknown ðŸŒ¸ Happy Tuesday ðŸŒ¸ #lovemyjob #ecphotos3 #canon #photooftheday #newyork #nyc #ny #ballerinaproject #ballerina #ballet #project #dance #letitmoveyou #expressyourself #point #shoes #dancelikenooneiswatching #dancephotography #cemtralpark #cherryblossom #nycballerina #dancephoto #love #myfirstlove #nycballet #home #naturallightphotography #naturallightphotographer #worldballetproject
