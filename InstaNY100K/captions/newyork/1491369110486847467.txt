Today is National Big Wind Day in the #usa !  We'll make a brouhaha of any event!! In 1934, the observatory of Mount Washington recorded 231 miles per hour winds. Now that's some serious gusto!  Be sure to respect this historical event and catch some major air at the dojo, today. #nationalbigwindday #celebrateeverything #cantmakethisup #ðŸŒª #ðŸ’¨ #ðŸŒ¬ #wowair #wow #whatwhat #aikido #nyc #newyork #manhattan #eastvillage #martialart #gotham
