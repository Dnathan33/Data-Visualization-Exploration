Took 2nd at the N.Y. Open this past weekend.  It's hard for me to be happy with anything short of first place but I'm surely not in this sport because it's an easy one! I love Jiu Jitsu and Martial Arts because of the constant challenge, not just in competition but in training every day.. Always learning and always growing...can't wait for the next one! . .  #ibjjf #newyork #jiujitsu #bjj #nogi #grappling #wrestling #jiujitsugirls #strongwomen #hardwork #obsession #bettereveryday
