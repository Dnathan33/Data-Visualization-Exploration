üòç I'm so happy with the way this cover up turned out! This beauty had her brows tattooed when she was 15 and was so unhappy with the job they did. After a few tattoo removal sessions she finally decided to try and have them covered and I'm SO happy she chose me to do it for her! We did a mix of microblading and powder to completely cover her prior tattoo. How's this for a before and after?! #eyebrows #torontobrows #kitchenerbrows #kwawesome #infinitibrows #anastasiabeverlyhills #hudabeauty #wakeupandmakeup #mac #torontostyle #permanentmakeup #permanenteyebrows #3dbrows #newyork #toronto #waterloo #archaddicts #makeup #fashion #tattoo #browtattoo #sephora #makeuplessons #eyebrowembroidery #torontomicroblading
