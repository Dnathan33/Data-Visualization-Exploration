Heading back from upstate NY today, this past week has been incredible. I finally got to meet my fiance's family! They are all so warm and welcoming, I cant wait to be a Cangello! Next step is meeting my future Mother In-Law!! ‚ù§ #family #NY #newyork #Rome #utica #casino #barhopping #upstateny #cangello #selfie #love #inlaws #vacation #friends #fiance
