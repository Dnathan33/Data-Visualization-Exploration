Week 13: Gotta go to Moe's...or do you?! I knew it was only a matter of time before I had to hit up @moessouthwestgrill for a burrito, and I opted for one filled with tofu, brown rice, pinto beans, corn, cheese, sour cream and guac. This pic was taken about two seconds before the 'rito disintegrated in my hands. It was still delicioso, just muy messy. Â¡Que lastima!
