"We certainly dodged a bullet,” said New York State Department of Environmental Conservation commissioner Basil Seggos after a barge carrying 2.5 million gallons of gasoline ran aground in the Hudson River just south of the Rip Van Winkle Bridge in the Village of Catskill on Tuesday.  The barge was carrying more than 60,000 barrels of refined gasoline from Newburgh to Albany when it struck a stone channel marker in the river. Crews removed the barge after low tide on Tuesday night and anchored it in open water until it was cleared to continue to Albany. The cause of the incident is not yet known and officials say if the boat did not hit the channel marker, it would have run into the shoreline. “Apparently the weather was bad. The visibility was bad. There was a high level of fog,” Governor Andrew Cuomo said. “It’s shocking to me how close it actually came.” Story on our website, northwoods.co.
