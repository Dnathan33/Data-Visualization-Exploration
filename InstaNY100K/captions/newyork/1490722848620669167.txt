#SOTD: Tuesday, April 11th, 2017  First time using the seasonal Barrister & Mann Rhapsody shaving soap and first time ever trying one of their aftershaves.  The scent of Rhapsody is hard to describe. It is fruity, citrusy, floral and slightly sweet.  It is not too heavy nor too bright. Right in between. It's the perfect scent for spring/late spring.  I love this shaving soap and the packaging/performance of B&M is definitely an A+.
