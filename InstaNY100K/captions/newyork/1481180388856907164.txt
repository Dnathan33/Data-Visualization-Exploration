I mean, it's a legitimate question 🤔 • • Funny story, I busted my upper lip last night at @vita_athletics while doing a warn up burpee and it was swollen almost instantly. I just laughed and asked myself, "why don't everyone do this?!!".. Not having your lip busted obviously 😂 • • Working out and taking care of yourself is a blessing and a privilege. We focus so much on what we have to lose rather than what we can actually gain (which is a whole lot!).. There are so many people who can't walk that would love to have your perfectly working legs. People who suffer from extreme heart issues who would love to be able to run a marathon at least once. Don't take your body and health for granted because when the time comes that you can't do what you can do now, you'll wish you took better care of yourself today. Yes, it takes time and effort but so does everything else in your life and health is a huge part of your life. Now go and make this day better than yesterday!! I'm done, bye 😝 • • #rantover #healthiswealth #loveyourself
