People fail to realize you have to eat to properly lose weight. Now not just eat anything in any amount you want, but the right portions and nutrients for YOUR body type. I started fluctuating 14 to a 4/13 to 5 in jrs since my time in the Navy. All that up and down is stess, lack of sleep, n lack of a consistent workout/meal plan. (Comes with the job)  @the_transform_her and @venice_like_the_beach have helped me keep off the weight I got rid of. I didn't lose it because I don't plan on finding it again!
