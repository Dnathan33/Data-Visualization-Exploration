Yesterday I decided that carbs were my best friend ðŸ˜’ I allowed a cheat day to come to early lol. Anyways after my lovely personal training session I indulged in a mini bagel with cream cheese, a veggie panini with fries and to top it of we went back for a dessert. I was upset but I refuse to let that take control. I am making sure today I eat a little cleaner and intake a lot of more liquids ! Water with lemon in my black Starbucks cup, @premierprotein shakes , a chopped salad with balsamic vinaigrette, 1 orange and the Snapple is there but I doubt I'll have it. Liquids plus some food but nothing crazy. . . . . #jujuxfit#julianasweightlossjourney#nyc#newyorkcity#newyork#fitnessjourney#fitness#weightloss#health#healthy#fitbit#fitbitflex2#vsg#vsgsurgery#vsgjourney#vsg#vsgcommunity#gastricsleeve#gastricsleevesurgery#gastricsleevecommunity#vsginstacrew#foodlog#foodprep#julianasfooddiary
