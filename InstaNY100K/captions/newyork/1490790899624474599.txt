"I am extremely excited for this partnership with USBOXLA. I have been following what they have been doing for a while now and their passion to grow the box game is evident. We share the same passion to grow box lacrosse in Upstate New York and the partnership will only help make our future programming that much stronger." - Â Knighthawks Academy Director and @rocknighthawks defenseman Brad Gillies  #usboxla #lacrosse #boxla #lax #boxlacrosse #nll #rochester #thinkinsidethebox #rochesterknighthawks #roc #newyork #ny
