Albert Anastasia, one of my least favorite gangsters. Pure menace, psychopath. I like the calm ones hidden in the background better. Gambino, Costello, Gigante. Guys like Anastasia, Genovese, and Gotti who try to do everything by force, well, they didn't last too long. Did you know Anastasia literally slapped Gambino at a meeting in front of the bosses? Slap the boss of bosses, ridiculous. No wonder he wound up dead soon after. Even though Gambino was under him, you just don't do that and apparently everyone else sided with Gambino. There were other reasons for the hit obviously but hearing that shocked me. Anastasia is an important part of LCN history, but I just don`t respect him. #albertanastasia #boss #don #cosanostra #mafia #mobster #mobsters #gangster #gangsters #nyc #newyorkcity #newyork #thegodfather #goodfellas #luckyluciano #pabloescobar #carlogambino #alcapone #calabria #italy #psycho
