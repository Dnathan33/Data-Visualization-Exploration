Had an awesome time hangin at the Saratoga Expo this weekend! Always great spending time in the company of local tattooers and seeing so many of you guys killin it! Thanks for scooping me a 1st place trophy on the fly Cat Rivera! And thanks to everyone who stopped by to get tattooed or talk about their ideas! Definitely looking forward to starting some awesome new projects! Sorry if I didn't have time for your walk-up or if you wanted a color tattoo! Just hit me up at the shop and I'll get you in! I'll be back Wednesday. Im taking a couple days to rest up and spend time with the fam. Oh, and my car broke down on the way home, full of equipment.. but hey it's just a car.. whatever.. It's a beautiful day and life is good! âœŒ  #art #tattoo #tattoos #tattooworkers #bloodmooncollective #ink #blackworkerssubmission #blackwork #justblack  #spotlightonartists #instagood #girlswithtattoos #guyswithtattoos #fineart #newyork #artnerd #evolvedmagazine #prophetsandpoets #tatsoul #blackclawneedle #inklife #tattooartistmag  #realtattoos #darkartists #inkedmag #inkstinctsubmission #skinartmag
