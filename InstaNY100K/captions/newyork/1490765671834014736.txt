日本東京～ 在日本的感覺, 最舒服的生活. 環境是最乾淨, 食物品質是最好, 每個人都很有禮貌. 建築雖然不是新的, 但是歷史和房子都保持的乾乾淨淨, 毫無損壞. 每一個地方都很有日本的味道, 所有東西都很精緻. 喜歡日本感覺的, 想把你們的愛展現在小時候看卡通的情節, 其實簡單的走一走, 就能把你們的愛融入在這一個地方, 把你們的愛展現! 😊😁🤗 Tokyo Japan! The feeling in Japan, one of the most comfortable city!  Streets are very clean, food is the best quality, people are very polite! Although the building isnt the newest, but they keep the old buildings very new! Its super clean and there isnt any broken pieces! If anyone loves the japanese style, or wants to see where most of the cartoon we seen as a child hood was produced, and wants your love story to be a part of it! Here is the place! Just simply walk and show your love here, and its already amazing! 😁😊🤗 For photography services please contact: Ethan Liu Photography Info@ethanliuphotography.com  We will lead you to express your love and happiness!  #losangeles #sanfrancisco #canada #newyork #eurpoe #italy #roma #prague #vienna #france #paris #wedding #prewedding #destination prewedding #photographer #weddingdress  #prewedding photographer #engagement #cityhall #ethanliuphotography #海外婚紗攝影 #婚禮拍攝 #攝影師 #婚禮 #iphonephotography #tokyo #japan #cherryblossom
