FOTOFILMIC17 ENTRANT #QUOTE . . "An image made with #film has a feel to it. . . The #photograph should be an accurate #record of what the #camera and film captured, with the absolute minimum disturbance of the captured image during the #processing and finishing stages. A #transparency film image processed through standard #chemistry is the paradigm for an #unmanipulated image" . .
