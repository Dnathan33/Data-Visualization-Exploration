Ive been to the Big Apple more than 80 times in my life. Half of those times were solo adventures wandering the streets, taking pictures, meeting strangers, going somewhere I'd never been before, and sitting in Central Park people watching. It never gets old. It's my favorite escape and I always look forward to my next visit ‚ù§#iheartnyc
